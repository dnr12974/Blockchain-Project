SEEDS Trust, jointly with the Livelihoods Fund, developed the ‘Ayyalur Livelihoods Project’, which seeks to restore the degraded and over-exploited land which is suitable for a biodiverse spread of medicinal, nutritional, traditional, and productive trees, shrubs, and crops. The species that are native or endemic to this region are favored by the local community, who forage the land to provide for themselves and supply goods to the traditional alternative medicine sector of India. These foraging and farming practices tend to put extra strain on the women in these communities and is additionally characterized by unequal benefit sharing. The overall project objective is to positively impact the livelihoods of over 8,000 household smallholder farmers by planting over 4.5 million tree seedlings on 8,000 ha of land with an intercropping of nutritional crops and shrubs; with the goal to sequestrate 1,411 net tCO2e over the crediting period.

The main project activities are constituted of the following:

1. Agroforestry practices involve fruit and grain supplements, such as Mango, Tamarind, Jackfruit, and Millet.
2. Border trees provide timber resources, climate resilience, and canopy cover.
3. Apiculture trainings and supplies, along with the increased habitat of Grey Slender Loris, an IUCN near-threatened species.

The project implementation is closely tied to the local community and involves workshops and training for all members of the community working towards reaching the Sustainable Development Goals.","70570","Afforestation/Reforestation GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Methodology","Large Scale","Standalone",""

The project will support at least 500 private landowners to plant, regenerate and maintain over 35 million trees over 26,000 ha leading to land restoration, carbon sequestration, climate resilience, improved livelihoods, jobs creation, increased food security and income generation. The Regeneration Kenya VPA-01 is the first real case VPA under the Regeneration Kenya PoA and will target 3500 ha of land and about 220 farmers, within Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo Counties. 
The RK project will be a country-level PoA encompassing rural farming areas of six counties in the Rift Valley Region in Western Kenya. Beyond VPA01, there is a potential to expand to West Pokot, Trans Nzoia and Nakuru Counties for future VPAs. 
The project enrols private landowners selected on the basis of eligibility criteria: i) demonstration of land ownership, ii) exclusion of the following- wetlands, peatlands, protected areas (national parks and forest reserves), riparian areas and land deforested or converted from the natural state within the last 10 years before the project start date.
Earthbanc AB will develop the RK PoA and corresponding VPAs as the Coordinating Managing Entity, implemented by Earthtree Company Limited and Green Planet Initiative (GPI2050) as the VPA implementers. The technologies to be employed include Afforestation and Reforestation activities carried out on private farmlands and Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) on degraded pasturelands (silvopasture). Afforestation will include planting native and naturalised exotic trees on agricultural land and restoration of native species through ANR on pasturelands. Additionally, activities will also include the production of Non-Timber Forest products, including the planting of other food crops and fruit trees like mulberry The multipurpose native and naturalised species planted in the project areas or landscapes will be at the proportion of 53.3% and 46.7%% respectively. The project encourages farmers to plant at least 4 species on small farms and at least 8 species on larger farms to promote biodiversity and to avoid monocropping. 
The project has one large central nursery and also uses some KFRI-certified nurseries for the supply of seedlings to farmers. The nursery utilises root-trainers, which are reusable for over 15 years, and will replace single-use poly bags. Land preparation will involve fencing and pit digging (pitting) which will be carried out by both hand-held tools and tractors. Seedling transplantation at the farm level will be done using manual and simple mechanical (customised / fabricated planting spears) means. 
The sites and land area are selected based on the Gold Standard A/R methodology stipulating the 10-year forest rule, whereby any land considered must have been converted to agricultural farmlands more than 10 years ago from the project start date. Landowners are enrolled in the RK Project voluntarily after a rigorous Free Prior, and Informed Consent Process (FPIC), each landowner is onboarded upon signing a landowner agreement that stipulates the roles, responsibilities, and benefits shared by both parties.
The project also has livelihood and business strategies. Within the planted or regenerated tree farms or woodlots, the project will promote alternative livelihood activities such as beekeeping and sericulture for honey and silk production, mulberry among others, for additional income. Trees will also generate gums, resins, fruits, nuts, leaf extracts and medicine that are processed for local and export markets.
To reduce biomass consumption and indoor air pollution, the project will distribute at least 3,000 improved cookstoves to different households, this will reduce firewood consumption, reduce deforestation and promote environmental conservation; improving health and indoor air quality.
The project aims to create carbon pools, ecosystem services (soil erosion control, watershed management and soil health), livelihood capitals and income streams from carbon credits, and possibly Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs).

IPFG’s mission is to promote active and fair involvement of both men and women in development activities. The project works closely with about 23,000 smallholder farmer households living adjacent to the Nyungwe National Park (NNP) and its buffer zone to implement agroforestry practices by planting 2.3 million trees on 13,741 ha of arable land. The project seeks to sequester around 1.48 net MtCO2e over 30 years. It obtains its seedling supplies from commercial nurseries and community nurseries. 
Project activities will be implemented in two districts of the Southern region – Nyamagabe and Nyaruguru. The main project activities are constituted of the following: 
1. Integration of Agroforestry trees inside food crop plots: Planting of fruits, nitrogen fixing, fuelwood and shade trees inside the plots.  
2. Integration of Agroforestry trees on boundary of food crop plots: Planting and managing fuelwood, timber, and fodder shrubs on the boundary of plots.  
3. Integration of trees in the boundary of tea plots: Planting shade trees around tea plots for shade provision.  
At the heart of these innovations lies IPFG’s active engagement of village-level farmers who are invited to partake in the execution of community-based agroforestry action plans. This collaborative effort is designed to rejuvenate their local landscapes and enhance soil quality, ultimately fostering increased agricultural productivity and climate resilience. In this process of participatory community agroforestry action planning, at a village-basis, a group of 7 representatives will be chosen to constitute an Environmental Committee. These committee members will be introduced to the project’s mission and provided with training on how to develop and disseminate Community Agroforestry Action Plans tailored to their specific village landscapes. Project participants will be trained on agroforestry, implementing Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), the project’s objectives, the development of community agroforestry action planning, dissemination, and farmer registration.  
The project’s core impacts are expected to be as followed: 
1. Reduced soil erosion: Protection measures against soil erosion will be planting of trees and improved fodder grasses in smallholder plots which are slowing runoff water and holding the soil. Leaves of planted trees reduce the impact of water droplets. 
2. Increased soil fertility: By implementing GAP practices such as composting, manure application, mulching and cover cropping, the soil improves in health, accumulating abundant organic matter and fostering a well-balanced ecosystem for crop growth.  
3. Reduced dependency on external inputs for crop production: Healthy soil enhances nutrient availability and diminishes the proliferation of pests through the presence of natural predators. Consequently, there is reduced dependency on chemical and synthetic inputs to enhance productivity.  
4. Diversification of income generating opportunities: Surplus products such as fruits, timber and fuelwood will broaden the farmers income opportunities, since they can be sold on local markets.  
5. Reduced Dependency on the NNP for forest products: Available fodder, bean stakes, fuelwood and mulch on plots will reduce incidences of resource conflict in the NNP. 
6. Increased farm trees, crop and food diversity: A mix of native, exotic and fruit trees will increase plant diversity therefore promoting biodiversity conservation. The promotion of crop rotation and green cover manure crops will have diversified available food in the farms and landscape.  
7. Reduced drudgery in households for forest provisions: Available fodder, bean stakes, fuelwood and mulch on plots will reduce drudgery of farmers in looking for these commodities in the NNP.

Word Forest uses a tried and tested approach, ensuring both environmental and social impact by supporting those who plant and care for the trees. This project will lease land from farmers for 30 years, protecting it with suitable fencing and involving locals in various tasks.
The investment not only funds tree planting but also supports essential social projects, including classroom building, permaculture training, women's empowerment initiatives, income generation workshops, and community sports activities. Regular monitoring of the trees ensures that surviving ones are compensated, encouraging farmers to safeguard and nurture the trees. Over five years, each acre absorbs at least 125 tonnes of CO2, sustaining this rate for another 25 years while funding ongoing social projects.
The organisation maintains a reliable network of trusted individuals across Kenya, which will allow us to secure more than 120 acres for the project. As a registered charity, their overheads remain minimal, allowing a significant portion of funds (at least 80%) to be directed towards the project. The leasing agreement ensures a long-term commitment from farmers, while the organisation shares income from trees like mango and cashew with landowners and Kenyan projects. This revenue also enables the construction of classrooms, installation of solar panels, and provision of training courses.
In Kenya, Word Forest has successfully planted trees for the past six years, leveraging their reputation for social benefit to gain the trust and support of local communities. The lease framework involves paying farmers a retaining fee for the land and a regular fee for each surviving tree, providing an incentive for diligent care. Training in permaculture and agroforestry methods further empowers farmers, ensuring sustainable and productive land for food security and potential income sources.
Overall, the Word Forest's reforestation efforts in Kenya align with Gold Standard certification and have significant environmental and social impacts. With strong community support and a focus on sustainable practices, the organisation is making a tangible difference in combating climate change and improving livelihoods in the region.

The initiative, which introduces better agricultural techniques for rice farming, is under the Land Use & Forestry (LUF) and Agriculture (AGR) category. This proposed project activity aimed at addressing the vulnerabilities posed by climate change in the agricultural sector, specifically focusing on rice cultivation—a critical component for ensuring food security in Ghana. Despite the sector's susceptibility to climate impacts, it has been noted that rice cultivation contributes to over 20 percent of Ghana's methane emissions, as highlighted in the country's fourth inventory report from 2019. Through enhanced water management techniques including alternating wetting and drying (AWD) of the paddy lands, this initiative seeks to minimise methane (CH4) emissions. For the duration of the farming season, in the absence of project activities, farmers in the project region presently employ the conventional technique of continual flooding. Because rice farms are now managed through constant floods and anaerobic soil degradation, the method of growing rice contributes significantly to CH4 emissions. Farmers will be motivated and trained to refrain from continuously flooding their fields by putting the suggested AWD technology into effect, which would cut down on the quantity of CH4 emissions that would have been produced in the baseline situation. In accordance with customs prevalent in the area, farmers utilise straw for domestic purposes following the paddy harvest. The sole change made to the project scenario is the adoption of alternating wetting and drying conditions rather than the submerged condition. Other than that, the project keeps the current agricultural techniques in place and does not introduce any new activities that might increase greenhouse gas emissions.

KG","Listed","1,6,15,5,13","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","India","The small-scale project “Safe Drinking Water Dharni, Melghat” aims at providing safe drinking water to the rural and indigenous communities in the “Tribal Belt of Central India”. Dharni Block is located in Melghat, a region which comprises one of the largest Tiger Reserves in India, the “Melghat Tiger Reserve”, a protected wildlife sanctuary with rich biodiversity, many endangered species and large forests stretching over the Satpura Hills. 
In the Dharni block of Melghat most people belong to indigenous communities such as Korku, Gond & Nihal tribes. They are reliant on unsafe water sources. Since decades Melghat shows one of the highest child mortality rates in India.  

The mission of the project is to reduce the burden of insufficient access to safe drinking water and the related prevalence of health issues from waterborne diseases for communities and individuals through a holistic and multi-faceted intervention approach. The target group of the project are households boiling unsafe drinking water using non-renewable biomass (firewood) and/or consuming unsafe water due to common barriers (suppressed demand). 
The main objective of the project is to distribute REDO Drinking Water Disinfection Liquid (packaged in 5 litre canisters) to approximately 24,000 underprivileged households (approx. 120,000 people), combined with a permanent refill option for each registered household on the village level. The technology implemented in the project, “REDO Water Disinfection Technology”, engineered in Germany, combines the advantages of the worldwide used, single oxidant drinking water disinfection methods in one liquid and one solution (“Mixed Oxidants”). REDO Technology won the ‘Federal Innovation Award’ of the German Government in 2004. In 2022 it has been recommended from the Indian Ministry of Jal Shakti (Water) for drinking water disinfection in rural areas. Today REDO Technology is used in 32 countries worldwide. Especially compared to chlorine REDO Technology has substantial advantages for drinking water disinfection in rural areas, which are mainly: a high disinfection efficacy, a long depot effect, no smell or taste or chlorine of the treated water and a liquid which is safe to handle through tribal villagers. 

In this project REDO Drinking Water Disinfection is implemented as a point-of-use and household water treatment technology (HWT). REDO Disinfection Liquid is provided to the rural, tribal households in 5 Liter Refill Canisters, to disinfect drinking water. The households dose the REDO Disinfection Liquid with a dosing ratio of 1:400 into the water (which means 50 ml REDO Disinfection liquid to be added to treat 20 liters of Water). After dosing, the disinfection liquid is mixed gently with the water, about 30 seconds later the water is ready and safe for drinking. 

Due to the switch to a more sustainable method of water treatment than boiling of water using non-renewable biomass or not treating the water at all, the need for firewood and therefore the burden on surrounding forests will be reduced. In the project region households depend on contaminated water for drinking purposes due to unimproved water sources (e.g. open wells and surface water), as well as improved water sources (eg. borewells and handpumps) which deliver unsafe water and due to unhygienic water collection and water storage conditions. The households rely on boiling water or insufficient methods (e.g. sieve or cloth filtration, alum) for water treatment. In addition, households consume unsafe water directly due to barrier factors.

The National Family Health Survey (2019-2020) of India highlights that while access to drinking water from improved sources has increased in the surveyed 22 states compared to the National Family Health Survey (2015-2016) , rural areas lag behind urban areas. The prevalence of waterborne diseases leads to an estimated economic burden of approximately USD 600 million per year in India.  According to the National Family Health Survey (2019-2020), access to clean fuel  in rural areas (23.6%) is also significantly behind urban areas (84.3%). The project seeks out to provide households in need for an environmentally friendly water treatment solution as well as households relying on non-renewable biomass as fuel source in forest and forest fringe villages. 

Following WHO guidelines the project will include activities to strengthen the project intervention, as for example awareness raising and early education activities on safe water, hygiene practices, transmission pathways for waterborne diseases, handwashing, open defecation and other WASH topics. 
All these activities will also include raising sensitivity and knowledge about the Melghat forests, its wildlife and biodiversity, woman empowerment, climate change and the scientific relations between climate change and water on planet earth.

a.	Afforestation of 7,080 ha partially shaded coffee farms: Planting 100 tree seedlings of avocado, river tamarind, durian, chinaberry, and candlenut per ha. The distribution of tree species differs based on altitude of the farm and the trees’ optimal growth conditions.
b.	Afforestation of 3,450 ha non-shaded coffee farms: Planting 200 tree seedlings of avocado, river tamarind, durian, chinaberry, and candlenut per ha. The distribution of tree species differs based on altitude of the farm and the trees’ optimal growth conditions.
c.	Afforestation of 994 ha unexplored wasteland: Planting 150 tree seedlings of candlenut and river tamarind per ha.
The project activities are responding to a chain of sustainability challenges: Increasing climate variability, sub-optimal management practices, and poor mitigation measures have led to a consistent degradation of the productivity of coffee farms. This limits income and livelihood opportunities of the dependent population, diminishing their resilience to climate change and pushing for further encroachment of the existing forest land. The project activities thus aim to tackle this vicious cycle by achieving the project’s environmental, economic, and social impacts. These core impacts include the following:
(1)	Enhanced climate resilience of coffee systems: The increased shade density and tree diversification will help regulate temperatures, reduce water stress, and protect coffee plants from harmful pests.
(2)	Improved soil fertility and water conservation: The agroforestry systems implemented will improve soil fertility through natural nutrient cycling and reduced erosion. It will also enhance water conservation by increasing infiltration rates and reducing runoff.
(3)	Reduced pressure on protected forests: The income generated from the increased productivity of the coffee farms and the harvest from fruit trees will reduce the need to expand coffee plantations through deforestation, conserving the Leuser Ecosystem and its biodiversity.
(4)	Increased and diversified income for farmers: The introduction of income-generating trees will increase farmers’ income by up to 20%. The diversified income source will also stabilize income and reduce the reliance on coffee.
(5)	Improved coffee productivity and quality: The increased shade density and improved soil fertility will contribute to higher coffee yields and quality, increasing the market value of Gayo coffee and farmers’ income.
(6)	Enhanced livelihoods for 10,000 smallholder farmers and their families: The project will directly benefit approximately 10,000 smallholder coffee farmers and their families by improving their income, providing access to resources, and enhancing their resilience to climate change.
(7)	Strengthened local capacity in sustainable agriculture practices: The project will provide farmers with training and coaching on best agricultural practices, soil conservation, and agroforestry management. This will empower local communities and build their capacity for sustainable agriculture.

With over 18 years of experience in sustainable development, our team is leading a 40 year agroforestry project in the Sector of Luabu, Kutu Territory, Mai Ndombe Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. This initiative actively contributes to 14 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring the highest standards for carbon credit generation and long-term social impact.
The Project in Motion:
Following a feasibility study in July 2023 and extensive stakeholder consultations, we secured agreements with local villages. By May 2024, the first seeds were planted in our nurseries, and by spring 2024, the first trees took root—marking the beginning of a transformative environmental and economic initiative. In year two of the project, we are expanding by planting eight different native tree species, further enhancing biodiversity and strengthening the ecosystem.

Addressing Deforestation and Land Degradation:
Our research revealed extensive deforestation caused by unsustainable charcoal production and harmful agricultural practices. Monoculture farming depletes soil within a few years, forcing farmers to clear more rainforest in search of fertile land. This vicious cycle has left vast areas barren while continuously reducing rainforest cover.
To reverse this trend, we are implementing agroforestry—a proven method to both protect existing forests and expand tree coverage. This approach creates a dual impact: preserving the rainforest while actively sequestering carbon through newly planted trees. Importantly, we only count newly planted trees in our carbon credit calculations, ensuring transparency and integrity. Preserving existing forests remains a vital goal, aligning with SDG 15 (Life on Land) but is not factored into our carbon credit numbers. Additionally, by planting diverse native species, we are increasing biodiversity and enhancing habitat quality for local wildlife.

Agroforestry for Long-Term Impact:
We are transforming fallow land next to untouched rainforest into natural buffer zones, protecting the existing ecosystem. The project starts with:
• 500 Wenge trees per hectare, known for their excellent carbon sequestration.
1,100 cacao trees per hectare, which thrive in the Wenge trees' shade, ensuring long-term protection.This natural pairing ensures that local farmers safeguard the Wenge trees to maintain their future cacao yields.To further support communities, we introduce fast-growing crops between trees, providing nourishment and immediate income within months. Farmers also receive financial incentives every three months for maintaining the planted trees, ensuring survival and growth for at least four years. These activities directly contribute to:
• SDG 1 (No Poverty): The agroforestry program generates stable, increased incomes in the short, medium, and long term, lifting families out of extreme poverty.
• SDG 2 (Zero Hunger): The diversified and increased agricultural production enhances food security, reducing hunger and improving nutrition through access to a wider variety of food.
Empowering Communities and Securing Livelihoods Beyond tree planting, we actively contribute to 12 additional UN Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring long-term sustainability:
• SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being): Increased income allows families to afford healthier diets and medical care.
• SDG 4 (Quality Education): Higher earnings help families afford school fees, and we collaborate with the Agronomy program in Duma 2 to integrate practical education.
• SDG 5 (Gender Equality): Women play a central role in agriculture, and we ensure their full participation in decision-making.
• SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation): We help communities protect and enhance their 
water sources while introducing accessible clean water technologies.
• SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy): By introducing solar energy solutions, we reduce 
dependency on wood, coal, and kerosene.
• SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Our program increases local incomes, 
creating economic stability and growth.
• SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure): We improve transportation by maintaining roads and providing transport vehicles, enabling farmers to sell their products
• SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Our activities provide job opportunities for vulnerable 
groups, including those with limited education and disabilities.
• SDG 13 (Climate Action): The core purpose of our work is to protect the rainforest and 
plant new trees to sequester carbon dioxide.
• SDG 15 (Life on Land): We actively protect existing rainforests and plant multiple tree 
species to enhance biodiversity.
• SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions): We help local populations secure legal 
land ownership, preventing future conflicts over land rights.
• SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): We facilitate global and local collaborations to bring 
advanced, eco-friendly technology and fair market opportunities to the community.

A Holistic Approach to Sustainable Growth 
Our local coordinator works closely with communities, ensuring full participation and long-term commitment. We also establish market connections, securing transportation, storage, and direct buyer access for farmers’ products. This comprehensive approach guarantees that forests remain a valuable, income-generating resource rather than being cleared for short-term gain.
The Future is Now 
This project is not just a vision—it is happening now. With a 40-year strategy in place, we are driving real, measurable impact for people and the planet, ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future for generations to come.

This establishment of a productive forest is expected to improve the livelihoods and well-being of community members, supported by the anticipated economic growth and biodiversity increase. Below, we provide descriptions of these two core activities:
1.      Afforestation and reforestation: The Grouped Project will produce high-quality, sustainable timber from eucalyptus plantations. Plantations will be established both in Paracel-owned properties and non-Paracel properties within Paracel’s Outgrower Scheme (OS), in historically degraded areas, in compliance with the national zero-deforestation law and VCS/IFC/FSC requirements for non-conversion of natural ecosystems.

2.      Native ecosystem restoration: This initiative will primarily focus on assisted natural regeneration, complemented by active restoration where necessary. The goal is to restore areas to their natural ecosystems, specifically the vegetation formations of the Cerrado. Given the complexity and lack of information on restoration systems in these transitional zones between the Cerrado, the Atlantic Forest, and the Chaco ecoregion, this restoration will be conducted in collaboration with researchers. The efforts will extend beyond legally mandated forest restoration zones, aligning with the ""super plus"" requirement stipulated for additionality.
The Grouped Project is located in the Northern Oriental region of Paraguay, with an expansion area bordered by the boundaries of the departments of Concepción, Amambay, San Pedro, and Canindeyu. The area of the project is not encompassed into a jurisdictional REDD+ program. The project activities are subject to the highest international standards such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forest management certification and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability for the plantation component, while also adhering to the principles of the IUCN landscape approach.
 
As of December 2023, Paracel has secured approximately 193.987 hectares of land, with 106.000 ha planned to be dedicated to plantations. The First Voluntary Project Activity (VPA-1) will take place on 35.764 ha (24.076 ha eligible) within the properties of Trementina and San Liberato, located in the Province of Concepcion. The activities consist of reforestation in the plantation areas (19.594 ha) and restoration of native ecosystem areas (4.482 ha). The remaining area will be gradually included in the project in future instances.
In the future, Paracel aims to secure a self-supply of wood for the pulp mill, including privately-owned wood and outgrower schemes (third-party plantations established through wood supply agreements with PARACEL) up to 215.000 ha of plantations. To realize this goal, the company plans to expand the project area by acquiring additional land and integrating outgrowers. 
The project generates significant social impact by creating direct and indirect employment opportunities, reducing unemployment and poverty levels in the affected areas. The project also improves social factors such as well-being, labor conditions, health, safety, and gender balance. Additionally, it enhances quality of life by improving housing and sanitation conditions, particularly benefiting vulnerable communities. 
On the biodiversity front, the project aims to protect and restore native ecosystems through conservation and restoration activities across approximately 82,000 hectares of conservation areas. It employs a Biodiversity Net Gain strategy, following the Mitigation Hierarchy, to avoid and mitigate impacts in native ecosystem areas and the associated fauna, implementing measures such as firebreaks, biological corridors, safety strips for agrochemical application, buffer zones around water bodies and protected areas, among others.

Rice is grown in flooded fields, which create the ideal anaerobic conditions for bacteria to thrive on decomposing organic matter (mainly rice straw residue) and release methane. Poor absorption by the rice plant of nitrogen-based fertilizers, often overused by farmers, leads to nitrous oxide emissions. Burning of rice residues and food loss and waste in the value chain add to GHG emissions.

It accounts for about 6 percent of the national rice area and 4 percent of production of India . In Assam, geoclimatic variations and agriculture's dependence on rainfall have resulted in three distinct rice growing seasons: sali or winter rice (June/July to November/December); ahu or autumn rice (March/April to June/July); and boro or summer rice (November/December to May/June).  The boro rice season is relatively risk-free, which means that improved rice production techniques could be adopted totally, and there is ample scope for area expansion by bringing the chronically flood-affected and deep-water rice areas under boro rice cultivation by creating irrigation facilities .

The VPA consists of implementation of Alternate and Wetting and Drying (AWD) practice in Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Dhubri and Bongaigaon districts of Assam. Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method and aerobic rice cultivation method is considered to be a scientifically proven way of managing rice fields for better water management and achieving reduction or avoidance of methane emission which is caused in traditional submerged rice fields. Therefore, Fair Climate Fund India Pvt. Ltd. (an Indian entity) has taken a voluntary initiative to develop a project in Assam which is designed specifically for Rice fields to adopt AWD Method, to be implemented across various districts and regions in the state of Assam. 

The objective of the project is to reduce methane emission by implementing advance water management technique, which include adoption of Adoption of Alternate, Wetting and Drying (AWD) method in rice fields.

The specific developmental change that our above interventions will bring is sustained deceleration of climate change by restoring degraded land at large scale to shift to Land Degradation Neutrality and Net Zero Emission target.

Globally land degradation has affected more than 3.2 billion people living in rural areas with least possible adaptation options that has resulted in major biodiversity loss and ecosystem services. Without efforts to restore and protect land, nearly 70 gigatonnes more carbon would be emitted by 2050 due to land use change and soil degradation, representing approximately 17 per cent of current annual greenhouse gas emissions. 

In the baseline we have land lying fallow, degraded land due to continued deforestation and soil degradation because of extensive cattle grazing, land development works, poor farming and water harvesting practices, and so on. Also, small landowners/ farmers are not actively engaged in soil health restoration or afforestation/agroforestry projects which are crucial for effective climate-change mitigation. In the marginalised community sector who are heavily dependent on natural resources, awareness of plantation activity still being less at the national level and the upfront capital constraints pose as big barriers to the adoption and penetration of plantation activity.

By producing renewable energy in the form of biogas, the project aims to improve energy independence by providing locally generated thermal energy. A sustainable method is used for waste management and handling leftovers digestate which will be utilized as nutrient-rich fertilizers to enhance agricultural productivity and soil quality. Biogas production from organic waste reduces methane emissions, a potential greenhouse gas, and will contribute to mitigating climate change by capturing and utilizing methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Biogas technology is an alternative to meet growing energy demand in emerging markets and rural areas. By leveraging the abundant livestock population in Nepal, the project taps into a significant resource base for biogas production considering the livestock population of 116.9 million, which includes about 7.4 million total population of cattle.

Over a third of households in India still relied on firewood as their primary source of cooking fuel in 2020-21. In rural areas, almost half (47 percent) of households were relying on firewood for cooking. Conventional cookstoves are used along with the traditional fuel such as wood, charcoal, and animal wastes for cooking food. The smoke coming out from the stove is injurious to health, may cause diseases like asthma, eye irritation, lung disorder, and sometimes may prove fatal. 
The aim of this project improving energy efficiency in households by the distribution of Improved cookstoves and thereby to reduce deforestation and land degradation This project allows to save thousands of trees, support families, boost economic activities, empower women and improve health conditions in India. The Improved cookstoves can reduce the need of wood by 50%. This results in less harmful greenhouse gas emissions and also considerably reduces the pressure on the local forests and biodiversity. The cookstoves generate less smoke and the chimney limits the exposure to smoke to help fight the problem of indoor air pollution and decrease respiratory diseases. Standard of living increases since families spend less budget on fuel and women experience a significant time gain that can be used for income-generating activities

In Uganda, less than 6% of the population has access to clean cooking. Specifically, 11.9% and 3.1% of Uganda's urban and rural residents have access to clean cooking fuels. This accounts for around 95% of households relying on either wood or charcoal as their primary energy source for cooking. Breaking this down further, about 68% of the Ugandan population use firewood as their primary source of cooking fuel, primarily in urban and peri-urban regions. The scenario in rural areas is more devastating, with 85% of the population using firewood as their cooking fuel.  
This heavy dependency on biomass has significantly burdened Uganda’s forest, contributing to one of the highest deforestation rates in Sub-saharan Africa. The country’s forest cover stands at 11.66%, but it is decreasing at an annual rate of 1.44%. A 2016-2017 National Household Survey found that 63% of firewood users collected the fuel from forests. Moreover, indoor air pollution from biomass use in residential cooking poses a serious health risk, leading to increased air-borne diseases and premature deaths. In 2022, around 3.7 million premature deaths were mainly attributed to household pollution from cooking smoke. While these stoves will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they also provide co-benefits to users.","165205","GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION","Large Scale","Standalone",""

"23154","Project Oasis","Arukah Capital Pte Ltd","Listed","8,7,5,13","Other","India","This project presents the generation and use of clean and renewable biogas (clean cooking and heating) and biofertiliser (organic soil amendment). The use of bovine manure, as a feedstock for the biodigester, reduces GHG emissions by both avoiding emissions due to open air storage, and also displacing conventionally used non-renewable fuels, such as firewood or liquid petroleum gas (LPG). The latter are typically used by smallholder dairy farmers for their energy needs both in the household and for productive uses on the farm.
The farmer level hardware technology used for this project is an anaerobic digester package that provides a comprehensive biodigester, clean cooking and fertiliser management system, coupled to a real time, solar-powered Internet of Things (IoT) sensor monitoring system that accurately records the volume of biogas produced and used. The chosen biodigesters are prefabricated hybrid reactors that can be installed easily and become a permanent piece of infrastructure for farmers to process the daily waste of a farm and livestock, adjusted appropriately for the livestock count of the household. This waste manure breaks down anaerobically in a closed chamber, instead of open air decomposition, within the closed chamber producing methane-rich biogas that can be used for providing clean cooking and thermal processes for the farm and household. 
The output of the digester is a nutrient-rich biofertiliser that is stored and applied to fields, paddies, and pastures as a substitute to chemical fertilisers. Other options can also be connected to the biogas system (e.g., biogas lamps, water heaters, and industrial burners). 
Arukah Capital has built a digital MRV system (dMRV) and incentive payment model for performance, to encourage an equitable share of revenue to project participants, and the long-term and sustained use of the biodigesters. The incentive payments are based on tracked performance i.e. biogas consumption, for this highly decentralised project type. The dMRV system includes real-time sensors tracking each installed biodigester, using mature technology to capture high frequency data for ongoing quality controls and performance analysis, incl. biogas production pressure and flow rates; and potentially messenger-based chatbot to provide farmers with direct updates of their performance. We are also engaging local implementation partners to support physical monitoring and ground operations, as required. The project comes with guarantee and a full-service package of installation, training and after sales-service from local technicians.

Currently, biomass makes up 88.5% of Malawi’s energy portfolio. Approximately 90% of Malawians depend on firewood or charcoal for their essential household energy requirements, with rural households relying exclusively on these fuels for cooking. This energy dependency has led to various environmental and socio-economic impacts.

iRise plans to distribute these cookstoves to 28,000 households located in rural communities within Kasungu District, Malawi, focusing particularly on Mpasadzi area.

The use of these stoves will lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, along with several other associated benefits such as decreasing wood consumption, which allows for natural forest recovery or reforestation efforts; mitigating soil erosion attributable to deforestation,' lowering health risks linked to traditional cooking methods; saving time and expenses for households in collecting or purchasing fuelwood respectively; and  generating local employment opportunities in stove production, distribution, and maintenance.","68320","GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION","Small Scale","Standalone",""

The specific description of the project activity is as follows: 1. The project activity entails the distribution and installation of an e-cooking solution with GSM functionalities developed by ATEC. 2. The project is being developed and implemented by ATEC, who will have the formal responsibility of implementing the project. 3. ATEC will work with local project implementers who will provide support in the management of the VPA in Nepal. 4. The project activity is a voluntary action by the project developer and will apply the Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices in the calculation of emission reductions. Goal and Objectives of the Project Activity The goal of the project activity is to replace the use of highly polluting non-renewable and fossil fuels used for cooking by households using biomass for cooking yet are connected to the grid. This will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with the use of traditionally unsustainable fuels such as wood and charcoal. These fuels are normally used on inefficient stoves such as 3 stone firewood stoves and unimproved wood and charcoal stoves. These will be replaced with a more efficient electric cookstove which will be distributed by the project activity. Specific Objectives 1. To promote electric cooking as a clean, reliable, convenient, and affordable fuel for cooking among households. 2. To provide an efficient cooking solution (e-cook, induction stove) to save on household expenditure on fuel, and time spent cooking. 3. To promote the use of digital technology such as mobile money in accessing basic services such as cooking.","100000","Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices","Large Scale","VPA","11815"

The prevalent use of traditional / inefficient cooking technologies in Uganda results in significant GHG emissions from use of non-renewable biomass (NRB) sourced unsustainably. Furthermore, the traditional solid biomass based cooking releases significant amounts of smoke, particulate matter (PM), exposing the primary cook to hazardous levels of indoor air pollution (IAP). The project ICSs are designed to be thermally more efficient than baseline stoves and hence reduce fuel consumption, cooking time and smoke, PM emissions. Thus the project reduces GHG emission, while simultaneously creating cleaner cooking environment for women and reduced IAP exposure to women and children.

Each VPA under the proposed Program of Activities will involve the implementation of the various measures that reduce anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in rice-cropping soils. Such measures include changing the water regime during the cultivation period from continuously to intermittently flooded conditions and/or a shortened period of flooded conditions, using the Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method, and switching from transplanted to direct-seeded rice (DSR) in Telangana. The purpose of the PoA is to enable CME to work with the farmers in the implementation of above water management measures in the paddy fields. CME, along with the VPA implementers in this PoA, is established and experienced in the field of the Agriculture Sector.

Policy/measure or stated goal of the VPA
The goal of the project activity is to reduce CH4 emissions through changing the water regime during the cultivation period from continuously to intermittently flooded conditions and/or a shortened period of flooded conditions, using the Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method, and switching from transplanted to direct-seeded rice (DSR) in rice cultivation, thus the programme contributes to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) and provides a healthy environment and sustainable development of India.

General description: 
Paddy fields are the most dominant anthropogenic sources of methane to the atmosphere (5-20% of the total emission from all anthropogenic sources1). Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants. The annual amount of CH4 emitted from a given area of rice is a function of the number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during the cultivation period, and organic and inorganic soil amendments. Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar also affect CH4 emissions. This CH4 emission-intensive cultivation method will be targeted by the proposed program, that will involve the implementation of the technology/measures that result in reduced anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in rice cropping soils and thus reduced generation of methane.  

The geographical location of the Voluntary Project Activity lies within the geographical boundary of Telangana, including the districts of Siddipet, Sircilla, Jangaon, Bhuvanagiri and Wanaparthy and is being implemented on 8799 hectares.
The Voluntary Project Activity comprises of rice fields implementing the following methods:  
(a) Rice farms that change the water regime during the cultivation period from continuously to intermittent flooded conditions and/or a shortened period of flooded conditions;
(b) Alternate wetting and drying method (AWD)
(c) Rice farms that change their rice cultivation practice from transplanted to direct seeded rice (DSR)

Thus, the measure will consist of AWD or AWD in combination with and/or DSR and an adjusted water management system in rice cultivation; and the baseline scenario is the continuation of the current practice e.g., continuously flooded rice cultivation in the project fields, in accordance with the Gold Standard Simplified Methodology for Methane emission reduction by adjusted water management practice in rice cultivation Version 1.1.","30170","Methane Emission Reduction By Adjusted Water Management Practice In Rice Cultivation","Large Scale","VPA","12542"

The goal of the project activity is to reduce CH4 emissions through changing the water regime during the cultivation period from continuously to intermittently flooded conditions and/or a shortened period of flooded conditions, using the Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method, and switching from transplanted to direct-seeded rice (DSR) in rice cultivation, thus the programme contributes to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) and provides a healthy environment and sustainable development of India.

General description: 
Paddy fields are the most dominant anthropogenic sources of methane to the atmosphere (5-20% of the total emission from all anthropogenic sources1). Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants. The annual amount of CH4 emitted from a given area of rice is a function of the number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during the cultivation period, and organic and inorganic soil amendments. Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar also affect CH4 emissions. This CH4 emission-intensive cultivation method will be targeted by the proposed program, that will involve the implementation of the technology/measures that result in reduced anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in rice cropping soils and thus reduced generation of methane.

The project aims to replace the traditional cooking mechanisms used by local people (three-stone fire or rudimental stoves) with ICSs that require less fuel and decrease biomass combustion emissions, with a consequent reduction of health hazards coming from indoor smoke pollution. The introduction of more efficient stoves will help to limit the demand for woody biomass, reducing the unsustainable use of forests and halting deforestation that is progressing rapidly in the Country. The ICSs deployment will also have a positive impact on women’s lives, reducing the time they spend collecting woody biomass and cooking the meals, giving them the possibility to invest their time more effectively. 
As a core activity, the project also involves the implementation of a specific component on health promotion at community level and local health system strengthening that will be performed in close cooperation with the Provincial Health Authorities and with direct involvement and training of local Community Health Workers. At community level, ICSs distribution will be integrated with the promotion of good nutritional, basic hygiene and health practices at all stages of the individual’s life, thus including the entire community, and preventing malaria in children under 5 and pregnant women. At provincial health facility level, the activities will focus on health staff capacity building, rehabilitation of facilities’ malnutrition rooms and units and provision of annual stock of micronutrients for pregnancy and children to respond to the chronic scarcity of these products.
Through the implementation of engagement and training processes dedicated to the local communities involved in the project, all the households receiving the ICS will be aware of the environmental improvements and the carbon finance benefit generated by their effective use of the stove. 
The project will contribute to pursuing 8 UN Sustainable Development Goals. The average annual GHG emission reduction expected with the implementation of the project is around 165,415 tCO2e per year considering two crediting periods.

The project is a greenfield project with four installation located separatly that aims to recover organic waste and produce electricity and heat, thus contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable agriculture and environment.

On each of the four locations we will use organic biodegradable waste (fresh/food waste) from food industry and its related/associated sectors of activities such as: supermarkets, meat and sausages factories, fruits and vegetable processing, fish processing, sugar, milk, alchoolic and non-alchoolic processing, expired and non-compliant products, yeast processing, restaurants etc.

Biogas is used to fuel a cogeneration unit (CHP) and to produce electricity and thermal energy, Electricity is delivered to the grid and internal consumption of the plant and thermal  is used entirely for heating process on site. The digestate is first sanitized and then separated into solid and liquid fractions, both used as organic fertilizer in agriculture.","229000","ACM0022 Alternative waste treatment processes","Large Scale","Standalone",""

The project technology is an improved cookstove designed and manufactured by Akili Holdings Ltd. in Kenya. It has a certified thermal efficiency of 30.5% resulting in a firewood savings of 66% compared to the traditional 3-stone open fire, thus an ideal replacement for the unsustainable open-fire stoves that are commonly used in the project area. The stove is designed with consideration of the local cooking culture, to ensure that the project’s environmental, social, and economic impacts are not achieved at the expense of local culture. The parts are composed of an outer iron steel case, and an inside liner which is made from high-quality clay material, mixed with a unique design of waste biomass to increase the thermal efficiency inside the liner walls. The stove’s rocket-like shape and the high insulation properties of the heat-resistant organic waste materials provide a cleaner and more efficient burning characteristic compared to the traditional open-fire cooking method. 
By agreeing to use the project ICS, the beneficiaries assign and transfer all rights on the carbon credits to Nature Kenya - the East Africa Natural History Society. Additionally, the use of the project ICS shall also result in improved household air quality consequently improving the health of women who are mostly actively involved in cooking activities; time savings for women and girls to engage in other activities; enhanced access to reliable and sustainable energy-efficient cooking technology; improved tree and vegetation cover; and employment opportunities. 
To measure the impacts created by the project, the monitoring/usage surveys, water boiling tests, and project kitchen performance tests shall be undertaken annually where the respondent end users will be randomly sampled from the project database.

The project ICS are high efficiency biomass cookstoves that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate matter (PM), thus improving indoor air quality in project households as well as many other benefits. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the traditional 3 stone fires (baseline stoves), the ICS reduces the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs. 

In the absence of the proposed (PoA), inefficient traditional 3-stone fires would continue to be used which is the dominant firewood end-use system in Malawi. 

The project ICS will replace the low efficiency 3-stone fires and emission reductions are achieved through improving household energy efficiency and reducing the consumption of non-renewable biomass.

The purpose of the POA is to disseminate the use of ICS in the Republic of Ghana, replacing traditional three-stone cookstoves with more efficient ICS.
ICS results in a notably more complete combustion of the fuel and is more efficient in transferring heat from the fuel to the cooking pot. This significantly reduces fuel consumption compared with the traditional three stone stoves in most households in the country. Furthermore, the proposed ICS will not generate any negative impact on any common cultural cooking practice since it will be compatible with all cooking utensils and cooking habits of the Ghanaian population.
By replacing inefficient cook stoves with the project ICSs, it is expected that this programme will help control the rapid forest loss and improve the quality of life of Ghanaians.
Additionally, the ICS will avoid/reduce time for harvesting fuel used for cooking and, since it has higher heating efficiency, it will consume less time for cooking, that historically is dominated by women. This efficiency will save money for the community and will enable women to spend time studying and pursuing other activities, empowering them, while promoting a sustainable development of local communities. In the absence of this project, Ghana community would maintain their baselines cooking conditions and, primarily, would cook using traditional inefficient stoves, continuing with environmental and health degradation.","0","GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION","Large Scale","POA",""

The Oeste de Caucaia - Ecofor is a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill located in Caucaia, Brazil. The landfill is owned by the municipality of Caucaia and operated since 2003 by ECOFOR, under a 20 year concession. The site property covers 116 hectares (ha), of which 84.1ha have been designated for waste disposal and is divided in 6 different disposal areas.

Previously to the implementation of the proposed CDM Project Activity no active collection of LFG took place in the project site. On the contrary, only a small portion of the gas was destructed using a passive venting system

The proposed CDM Project Activity consists of capturing the landfill gas (LFG) generated by the landfill using an active LFG capture system and injecting it into a natural gas distribution network (after a purification process), displacing the use of natural gas. Any LFG excess will be flared. GNR Fortaleza Valorização de Biogás Ltda., which is the project activity implementer, understands that flaring shall be always the very last option of any CDM project related to LFG destruction.

The project activity is expected to have 7,500Nm3/h processing capacity. Depending on the project performance up to 2017, a second and third phase may be implemented. Then, 12,500Nm3/h processing capacity may be achieved from 2018 to 2028 (phase II) and 15,000 Nm3/h in 2029 onwards (phase III). Then, the estimated emission reductions considered this expansion scenario, resulting in an annual average 498,097 tCO2e/yr. By the end of the first crediting period, the project is expected to reduce on total 3,486,678 tCO2e.

The Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project Activity will have a substantial positive impact in terms of sustainable development as it will be one of the first projects that purify the LFG and injects it to a network distribution grid being developed in Brazil that, as consequence, directly displaces natural gas.
An environmental benefit with the implementation of the Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project is the destruction of methane that otherwise would be emitted to the atmosphere, increasing the impact on global warming. Despite of being possibly flared if necessary, the landfill gas collected will be primarily injected (after the upgrading process) into the natural gas distribution grid, therefore avoiding the consumption of natural gas.

Our focus lies in distributing ceramic candle water filters, impregnated with silver nanoparticles and filled with activated carbon, specifically targeting low-income households in both rural and urban areas. This effort is facilitated through a network of resellers and microfinance institutions (MFIs). The core objective is to make affordable Nazava Water Filters available, capable of effectively removing contaminants and ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water to households and institutions. The project is large-scale and has a duration of 10 years (5 years, renewable twice).

The project will involve the distribution of the Nazava Water Filter in Kenya as the planned target area for the project implementation. The project owner Nazava Water Filters Limited will do the preparation and implementation of the project.

The project addresses a critical issue in Kenya, where many people lack access to safe drinking water. This lack of access to safe drinking water leads to waterborne diseases like diarrhea, which causes significant health problems and even death, especially among children. Nazava’s ceramic filters offer a solution by providing a continuous supply of microbiologically safe drinking water. 

The Nazava Water Filter, see Figure 1, is a 2x16-liter ceramic water filter with a flow speed of 2 liters per hour. The 2x16-liters ensure a full-day supply of drinking water for the whole household. The upper compartment is where the inflow of unsafe water occurs whereas the second compartment contains the filtered purified water with an outlet attached to it. The Nazava ceramic filter candle called the Nazava PROT3CT has three main working components.
The ceramic filter with pores of 0.4 micron filters out bacteria.
The nanosilver particles mixed with the ceramic kills the bacteria.
The activated carbon inside the ceramic improves the taste, odor and color.

Using this technology, households can filter their own tap, well, river or rainwater. All these filters come with a local language user manual with clear directions, an indicator for filter replacement and a one-year warranty card. The Nazava Water Filter has been shown to effectively reduce diarrhea diseases, with independent tests and assessments available.

R. China. It is developed by Henan BCCY Environmental Energy Co., Ltd. The collected LFG will be used for electricity production.

Wenxi county landfill site (Hereafter referred as Wenxi county landfill site) is a sanitary landfill site, which started operation in May 2018 with a total design effective capacity of 900,000 m3 and an operational lifespan of 11 years. Now it received municipal solid waste of 250 tons/d. The proposed project activity has a total designed capacity 1.0MW (2*500kW) and combusts the LFG, which contains nearly 50% of methane, to generate electricity and export it to the North China Power Grid (NCPG). 

The proposed project activity collects and utilizes LFG from Wenxi county landfill site for power generation, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Methane in the LFG has been emitted to the atmosphere since the landfill started operation. Therefore, the proposed project activity avoids methane emissions and, at the same time, electricity is generated from a renewable energy source, instead of being provided by the grid.

The exported electricity is estimated to be 4,066 MWh a year on average. The estimated annual average emission reduction generated by the proposed project activity over the crediting period (the crediting period is 5 years) is 23,628 tCO2e per year by avoiding the CH4 emissions from the landfill and the CO2 emissions from the fossil fuel power plants in the NCPG.

ArboRise Participative Reforestation in Upper Guinea is a project that proceeds by cycles of 3 years, during which it visits 25 villages to engage 250 ‘seed families’ and 250 ‘field families’ to reforest 1500 hectares. Thus, over 4 cycles, in 12 years, the project aims to cover 6000 hectares with the help of 2000 local families in 100 villages. The project started reforestation activities in 2021 and will continue until 2033. 150 hectares were reforested in 2021 and 500 hectares are reforested every following year until 2033. The project applies assisted natural regeneration measures and natural reforestation methods that strengthen biodiversity and seeks to maximize the involvement of local populations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the reforested areas. Seeds of a mix of 40 local forest species are directly harvested around the villages, and are thus adapted to the area, to ensure sustainability. The seeds are directly collected from many local growers, so called ‘seed families’, to which the project provides an income that helps enhance their forest heritage and promote agroforestry practices. “Seed families” have a seed tree, from which 20,000 seeds are collected per year. The project disperses seeds on the land through direct sowing with the help of the local population. In addition, landowners wishing to revitalize their land may invite arboRise to reforest a few hectares, we call them ‘field families’, and there is no change in land ownership. ‘Field families’ each make 6 hectares available. The project sows 10,000 seeds per hectare, which is added to natural regeneration. The “field families” implement measures to ensure the protection and growth of those forests and harvest non-timber forest products (fruits, seeds, fodder, etc.) according to the principles of agroforestry. There is no commercial logging activity in this project, only targeted thinning and pruning may be done to promote the growth of trees with high sequestration potential.","0","Afforestation/Reforestation GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Methodology","Small Scale","Standalone",""

The studies indicate that Nepal is among the 14 nations worldwide whose access to safe drinking water has decreased over the course of the last 20 years, from 2000 to 2020. This finding is paradoxical to the government's goal of achieving universal access to responsibly managed water everywhere. 
According to the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage Management (DWSSM) Nepal, 82.88 % of the households in the Mountain region, 80.50% of the households in the Hill region, and 18.62% of the households in the Terai region have access to a piped water supply. While 80% of the population in Nepal is considered to have access to drinking water, the water is unsafe for use. Microbial quality assessed from water samples from household water storage containers and the points of sources in rural communities in the hilly area of western Nepal showed E. coli in 81% of the stored drinking water. According to a survey from 146 households and 603 individual widespread bacterial contamination was found in the water sources, with 94% of sources having detectable total or faecal coliform. Accessing safe water is extremely difficult for the 1.7 million people of the Kathmandu Valley. Although there is a municipal tap water system, even for those who have access to tap water in their homes, it is only available intermittently, especially after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake of April 2015. Numerous studies have reported that bacterial contamination affected over 80% of samples, including water from dug wells, stone spouts, shallow tube wells, deep tube wells, tap water, and bottled water.
	The project involves implementing water treatment technology for households, that otherwise boil unsafe drinking water using non-renewable sources and/or depend on the consumption of unsafe water due to various barrier factors or use energy exhaustive methods to purify water thereby contributing to the emissions by Nepal. The project implementation will save 68,779 tCO2 emissions annually.

Water access is acknowledged as a fundamental human right since it is essential to human health and existence. Notwithstanding significant progress, access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities remains challenging for humanity. 
West Africa is among the regions with the lowest access to safe drinking water. By 2025, over sixty percent of West African countries will face water scarcity, and about eighty percent of surface water will witness eutrophication. The access to water and proper sanitation in these regions remain abysmal at less than 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively. 
Similarly, the South Asian region also faces water scarcity and open defecation challenges. According to the UNICEF analysis, over 134 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, and about 86-84 percent of water sources in South Asia are contaminated. 
Water scarcity, water contamination, and open defecation have huge health, social, and ecological costs. Lack of access to safe drinking water results in people drinking untreated and potentially contaminated drinking water, resulting in diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. Also, as women and young girls are primarily responsible for water collection in most households without drinking water on their premises, water collection takes away a significant portion of their time and hampers crucial activities such as going to school, caring for their health, and improving their skills. It also exposes women to risks of accidents and sexual violence. 
Moreover, using wood for boiling water adds to deforestation, fueling biodiversity loss and has adverse climate implications due to greenhouse gas emission.

Currently, households predominantly rely on solid biomass for cooking, primarily firewood, using rudimentary three stone cookstoves. This reliance leads to extensive time spent on firewood collection, deforestation, land degradation, and significant greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Moreover, it poses serious health risks due to exposure to smoke and emissions.

Implemented by Infinite Earth Private Limited, the project intends to distribute energy-efficient cookstoves with a thermal efficiency of 36.42%, utilizing natural draft technology. These stoves aim to enable households to cook the same amount of food with less firewood consumption, thereby mitigating environmental degradation and health hazards associated with traditional cooking methods.

The project targets distributing up to 15,000 energy-efficient stoves to replace inefficient biomass stoves in households. The distribution will be done at zero cost to the households, with revenue generated solely through emission reduction certificates. This revenue model aims to incentivize the uptake of efficient stoves while discouraging the use of baseline inefficient stoves.

The project's geographical boundary covers the Gairatganj block in Raisen District, Madhya Pradesh, India. Over the first crediting period, the project anticipates a total emission reduction of 250,598 tons of CO2, with an average annual reduction of 50,120 tons of CO2.

In summary, the project seeks to promote sustainable cooking practices by providing energy-efficient stoves to households in Raisen District, thereby reducing fuelwood consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and health risks associated with traditional cooking methods. It employs a revenue generation model through emission reduction certificates to facilitate widespread adoption of efficient stoves.","50120","GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION","Small Scale","Standalone",""

We are to distribute 4,000 improved cookstove to the rural families in the mentioned area. 
The objective is to reduce in-house pollution by replacing conventional chulha with an improved cookstove. The step will affect the health of women and children positively. This will also improve the productive working hour in women’s life by reducing time taken to collect firewood. In addition the project aims to substantially reduce GHG emission by reducing the requirement of firewood for cooking purpose. 
In the rural areas of Karauli, many households use the traditional Chulha for daily cooking for family and livestock food requirements. This cooking practice generates numerous social and environmental problems, such as increased health problems related to smoke emissions, use of wood leading to deforestation, time spent on unproductive activities like wood collection, and high generation of GHG emissions with wood burning. The improved cookstoves will contribute to mitigate all these factors by reducing wood consumption for daily cooking and generating less smoke. This project will lead to enhanced living conditions of the beneficiaries in the region.

In the country in general and Inhambane province in particular, many families cook using traditional stoves which are inefficient and consume large amounts of charcoal. In recent years this resource is becoming scarce and consequently the price increases: this is due to human pressure on resources caused by population growth and indiscriminate tree felling. This phenomenon worsens the living conditions of low-income families who depend entirely on charcoal as the only source of fuel to cook food. Another negative effect associated with the use of inefficient cookstoves is the constant exposure to smoke that causes or worsens respiratory, eye and skin diseases.
Carbonsink plans to develop a project for the production and distribution of energy efficient stoves in the districts of Inhambane province. Project activities are scheduled to start in September 2022 and the project developer foresee to distribute a total of 20,000 efficient stoves initially in the districts of Massinga and Morrumbene and later to cover other districts of the province.
The project will distribute locally produced Mbaula A stoves composed of ceramic internal part and metallic (aluminium) outer skirt and base. These stoves will address the challenges pointed as they aid reducing the consumption of charcoal.

The company started production of food-grade rPET in 2012. Bariq facility is located in CPC Industrial Park on the 6th of October city, Giza. Bariq uses post-consumer PET bottles from Municipal Solid Waste that would otherwise go to landfill or burned. Bariq produces recycled pallets ready to be used in the injection-blowing industry for bottles. Bariq holds a positive EFSA opinion (see EFSA Certificates in the following LINK) and an FDA Letter of Non-Objection (LNO). Health Canada approval, REACH &amp; GRS compliant PET pellets. Bariq'I's facility is compliant with BRC and SEDEX. 
Bariq decided to expand its capacities and increase its contribution to fighting climate change by installing a new recycling line ""recoSTAR PET ART"" first of its kind in the Middle East to increase its capacity from 15,000 tonnes to 33 tonnes annually (please see Attestation Letter from Starlinger in this LINK). This will be done in October 2023 and will operate its second recycling line Starlinger ""recoSTAR PET ART"", which will raise its production capacity to 33,000 tonnes. Bariq is currently recycling 1.6 billion PET bottles per year and a total of 15 billion PET bottles since its establishment which contributed to saving more than 260,000 tons of CO2.
Bales of PET bottles are received from collected & sorted municipal waste. The bales must only contain post-consumer PET bottles. Each batch received is checked to make sure that it doesn’t contain more than 5% PET bottles that are coming from non-food content (Detergents, cosmetics, etc.). The material is further sorted in an automated pre-sorting line to remove labels, caps, and other non-PET materials if present. The sorted material is then transferred to the cold washing stage to remove any remaining label, sand, or dirt attached to the bottle body. After that, the bottles are sorted by second automated machines to remove colored, non-PET bottles, metals, and any contaminants. 
The sorted materials are then shredded into flakes which are transferred by pipe to a floating tank to remove labels and caps (poly olefine separation). These shredded flakes are hot-washed with water (90°C) and caustic soda. After drying the flakes, it transferred to another grinder equipped with sieving screens to remove the dust and homogenize the size of the flakes. These flakes are transferred to the 3rd automated sorting stage (2 machines) (optical sorter machine followed by polymer sorter machine) and finally, the shredded flakes are packed into big bags.
The flakes pre-processed through the mentioned method are then decontaminated using Starlinger technology. This consists of a pelletizing unit, an inline crystallizer, and a solid-state polycondensation unit (SSP). The CDU, EX, CRY, and SSP are the critical stages for the decontamination of the material. The critical parameters that are relevant for decontamination are temperature, residence time, and vacuum level at different stages of the process. (please see Line Description in the following LINK)
Each production batch is tested as per Bariq’s Quality control procedures which define procedures for operation and troubleshooting. Quality checks are carried out as per the quality manual to ensure that the material has been produced meeting the specifications of the process for the entire batch. The rPET produced by the above-mentioned procedure is then packed into big bags of (1200) kg and labeled with the respective batch numbers and production date.","20851","AMS-III.AJ.

It is estimated that in the period from January 30, 2023 to January 29, 2030, filter units will be delivered to 15,000 families, benefiting more than 60,000 people with a potential for future expansion. These filters significantly improve the quality of drinking water by removing sediments, viruses and bacteria for human consumption, thereby reducing the risk of gastrointestinal diseases and the number of deaths in Honduras, including infant deaths from infections. The water purification filters also avoid the need for boiling, generating economic savings associated with the reduction of fuel use and the purchase of bottled water, and in turn reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The landfill started the operation in August 2013, receiving solid waste (type Class II-A Inert and Class II-B Non-inert) .

The project activity results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTR Rosario through two ways:
i.	Burning CH4 in flares and/or group generators;
ii.	The amount of electricity generated in the project activity is dispatched to the Brazilian national grid, avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil-fuelled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development.

Prior to the implementation of the project activity, the scenario for (i) LFG destruction was the partial released to atmosphere through the exiting LFG passive capture system and partial and intermittent LFG combustion in gas wells. Regarding the (ii) electricity generation, the baseline scenario is the generation in existing and/or new grid-connected power plants.

The baseline scenario is the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity.

The project activity aims to capture and to flare the LFG and to generate electricity through the implementation of a power generation plant using LFG. The generation installed capacity during the second crediting period is equal to 3.0 MW (3 x 1.0 MW).
The project constructed an efficient capture, collection and flaring system to burn CH4 (a greenhouse gas), and this reduced odours and adverse environmental impacts. Moreover, it installs generators that combusts the LFG to produce electricity, using part of the electricity for self-consumption and the other part is exported to the grid. The flares are kept in operation due to LFG excess, periods when electricity is not be produced or other operational considerations. The LFG power plant has 3.0 MW (3 x 1.0 MW) installed.

The LFG capture and collection systems and flaring station consists of a LFG pipeline grid and a flaring station, equipped with flares, centrifugal blowers, and all other supporting mechanical and electrical subsystems and appurtenances necessary to run the system. The power generation facility comprises of LFG engine generator sets of high-performance standards. The engine-generator sets are the primary equipment to combust the collected LFG once they are installed. A fraction of the collected LFG is diverted to flares, which is used to combust any gas in excess of the fuel demand for the engines, as well as a contingency backup.

The lifetime of the landfill is expected to be 25 years since the starting operation, according to technical study . The equipment that is installed in the project site is all new.","135636","ACM0001 Flaring or use of landfill gas","Large Scale","Standalone",""

India, the second-largest global producer of rice, heavily relies on rice cultivation for food security and economic stability. The predominant cultivation method in India, Transplanted Puddled Rice (TPR), is a major source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, accounting for about 8% of all human-caused emissions.

Bayer, as a global leader in the agricultural market, has developed the Rice Carbon project to address the twin issues of food security and climate change. The project aims to enhance rice management practices by promoting economically and environmentally sustainable techniques. This initiative benefits farmers, society, and the planet by reducing emissions and fostering climate-smart practices.

The project aims to reduce methane emissions by reducing anaerobic decomposition of organic matter through climate-friendly cultivation methods like AWD (Alternate wetting and drying method) and DSR (Direct-seeded Rice), targeting the intensive methane-emitting practices in rice farming.

The project will lead to water and fuel savings, labour use reduction in case DSR practice and a significant reduction in methane emissions from rice fields.","51147","CDM METHODOLOGY - AMS-III.AU “METHANE EMISSION REDUCTION BY ADJUSTED WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IN RICE CULTIVATION","Small Scale","Standalone",""

The forest is planted eyeing both CO2 sequestration and biodiversity. Apart from forestry activities (P1), the project also aims to collaborate with the local population (P2), develop lowcarbon economic activities (P3) and provide infrastructure for the local population (P4).
The forest will be planted (P1) aiming to improve biodiversity in an area of 14,430 ha. A list of 20 tree species has been selected. It contains a mix of fast growing plantation species and slow growing forest trees, including as many endemic tree species as possible. The project area has not had forest since at least 1985, but secondary forest has been preserved in the forest galleries (galleries forestières) in the river valley. Due to the frequent man-made fires the project area would remain open under a baseline scenario. We keep intense contact with the local population (P2) in relation to all project activities. The focus is to prevent forest burning through educating people about controlled fire, as slash and burn is the traditional way of agriculture. 12 brigadiers are permanently guarding the forest (P1), go in conversation with the local population to prevent forest fires and will be equipped to extinguish forest fires. Also, the implementation of economic activities for smallholders (P3) and correct use and maintenance of the social infrastructure (P4) is envisioned.
In the long run, we will promote local economic activities to able income for the local population (P3). The ratio behind that is that afforestation activities only provide temporary jobs. By promoting local economic development, we can provide sustainable employment. Local employment prevents deforestation as people will no longer depend only on income from unsustainable exploitation of the Savannah and galleries forestières. Different economic branches ’will be developed at different scales. We will be investigating -hierarchy magnitude- among others, the culture and sale of honey, fruit and fruit juices, fish culture, sustainable charcoal and manioc flour.

Through this project, the distribution and installation of ICS will be undertaken for households and communities/non-household. It is intended that under this project high thermal efficient cook stoves will be distributed. The ICS will burn wood more efficiently thereby improving thermal transfer to pots, hence saving fuel and greenhouse gases. Not only will this halt the rapidly progressing deforestation but will also reduce health hazards from indoor smoke pollution and women and children will have to spend less time collecting firewood. 
 
The ICS will substitute the currently common cooking on open fire or traditional cook stoves. The ICS burns wood more efficiently thereby improving thermal transfer to pots, hence saving fuel and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. 

The baseline scenario is the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel by the target population to meet similar thermal energy needs as provided by project cookstoves in absence of project activity.

Each facility will have an installed power capacity of 6.043 MWp, a total of 12.086 MWp but the production of energy will be limited by the nominal power of the invertors equipment that is 5 MW. The goal of these facilities is to align with the government's plan to increase power generation in the country, in order to meet the growing demand and diversify the sources of power.
The solar photovoltaic facilities will provide a clean and renewable source of energy that will reduce the country's carbon footprint and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. This project is an important step towards achieving sustainable development in Cape Verde, and will have positive impacts on the environment, economy, and society.
The project aims to replace the current anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG's) estimated to be approximately 13,998 tCO2e per annum. This will be achieved by displacing an average of 21,540 MWh/year of electricity that is currently being produced by thermal fossil fuel based power plants.
In addition to reducing GHG emissions and diversifying the sources of power, the project will also create job opportunities and boost the local economy. It will involve the installation of solar panels, inverters, transformers, and other necessary equipment, which will require local labor and contribute to the development of the renewable energy industry in the country.
In Cape Verde, solar energy currently represents only about 2% of all electric power plants in the country. Therefore, the creation of two new greenfields solar photovoltaic facilities is a crucial step towards increasing the share of renewable energy in Cape Verde's energy mix.

The high biomass consumption has negative impacts on the environment leading to deforestation and land degradation, Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) emissions, loss of soil fertility and soils’ reduced ability of water retention. Further, indoor air pollution through health-damaging pollutants while combusting firewood and charcoal result in diseases like e.g. pneumonia, stroke, ischemic heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and lung cancer. The project activity will relieve these negative impacts. ","27285","GS TPDDTEC v3.1","Large Scale","VPA","10789"

Natural resources such as water and firewood are increasingly rare, causing tension between host communities and refugees. As a result, refugees must travel increasingly large distances to collect firewood. This is a high-risk activity, as many women are subject to sexual and gender-based violence. The project aims to address this issue and meet basic domestic energy needs through the distribution of solar cookers in the refugee camps to reduce dependency on biomass for cooking.

Kiasi Energies will disseminate fixed Improved Cookstove (ICS) in Cameroon that will drastically increase community access to clean cooking solutions by providing, installing, and maintaining energy efficient and smoke reducing cookstoves. These improved cookstoves will be distributed for free. The aim of the project is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases incurred by high wood consuming cooking practices. Indeed, in Northern Cameroon, a large part of the population is still cooking with a three-stone fire. However, fewer and fewer wood resources are available in this region, making it costly and time consuming to find wood for the households. 

The distribution of these stoves directly improves energy access and reduces wood fuel consumption, thus slowing down deforestation. It is expected to prevent the emission of 245 000 t of CO2eq per year, on average.

There is significant dependence on polluting traditional/3-stone chullahs (fuelwood stoves) for cooking in rural and semi-urban households in the country (India). Indoor Air pollution can cause diseases and women are particularly affected due to their direct exposure to cooking fires and involvement in daily cooking. Combustion of the non-renewable fuels and release of greenhouse gas emissions in the environment adds to global warming problem. 
The proposed project will be addressing this problem by providing access to improved cooking solutions (ICS) in the form of energy efficient cookstoves. This is a voluntary initiative by EVI Green Markets Pte. Ltd. Under the program improved cooking solutions (ICS) shall be provided to the marginalized households living in rural areas of India. 
The baseline scenario is the continued use of non-renewable fuelwood by the target population in absence of project activity in rudimentary cook stoves which are energy inefficient and highly polluting causing severe discomfort and health concerns to the households. 
The Project Activity (PA) shall be implemented in the state of Madhya Pradesh with distribution of 1,000 ICS, which can be further expanded. The average annual GHG emission reductions from the project activity are expected to be 2,431 tCO2e.

Esperanza power plant will be located in the Esperanza municipality, province of Valverde in the Dominican Republic.

Esperanza power plant will have an installed capacity of 90 MW  and involves the installation and construction of the following components: photovoltaic solar panels on embedded metal structures, three-phase inverters, transformers, medium and high voltage electrical networks, electrical substation, warehouse, administrative and control buildings, access roads, internal roads and platforms, parking lots, green areas, among others. In addition, it will have all the facilities for this type of project such as drinking water system, domestic wastewater system, system for the management and disposal of solid waste during the construction and operation stages of the project.
The energy that will be generated by the proposed project activity is currently dispatched by other grid-connected power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and in the absence of the proposed project, the electricity would have been generated by national grid connected plants, which includes fossil fueled power sources.
The project aims to provide clean, renewable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the National Interconnected Electrical System (SENI ) of the Dominican Republic. It will help in meeting the increasing demand for energy to bolster the nation’s expanding economy. By harnessing solar energy, an abundant renewable energy resource in the country, the project will not just provide clean energy to the national grid but will also reduce the high dependence on imported fossil fuels. In addition, the project will contribute towards bridging the gap between demand and supply of power and therefore, strengthening the national energy security. By generating an annual average of 198 312 MWh/y, the project is expected to reduce an average of 123 271 tCO2e of emissions annually, contributing to SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). The project will also contribute to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by providing equal work opportunities to all, irrespective of discrimination on any basis.

The project has a total installed capacity of 175.5 MW, an annual net electricity generation of 403,955 MWh and an emission reduction of 276,706 tCO2 each year. The electricity generated by the project supplies to the National Electric System (SEN in Spanish).
It is expected that, when the project becomes fully operational, will displace fossil fuel fired power stations avoiding the emission of 316,417 tCO2 each year and 1,936,963 tCO2 during the first crediting period. 
As the project activity is a greenfield renewable energy power plant, the scenario existing prior its implementation is a semi-desert, sparse vegetated, coastal winded pasture and shrub land, where neither facilities nor crops existed previously.
According to the ACM0002, as the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power plant, the baseline scenario is the “electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”. Baseline scenario would be a continuation of the current practice.
The project activity increases the percentage of renewable sourced power in the Chilean grids, promoting the growth of renewable capacity and diversifying the Chilean generation mix, significantly contributing to the sustainable development of the region. This represents a quite important solution, as the SIC (Central Interconnected System) electric generation mix was mainly weighted towards fossil fuels.

The project boundary is highly subjected to forest degradation triggered by anthropogenic activities. Extensive use of nonrenewable biomass for household energy and expansion of agricultural land are the major contributors to forest degradation in the project boundary. To reduce the use of non-renewable biomass for household cooking, EECMY DASSC designed a  project aimed to disseminate high efficient locally produced multipurpose cook stove called “Bilise stove” (mean free from burden/challenge) for households in the project boundary that meet their cooking demand. The stoves have thermal efficiency of 32% and will reduce the amount of fuel consumed for cooking thereby reducing GHG emissions, forest degradation, and improve the health condition of local community.","40000","GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION","Small Scale","Standalone",""

The project activity will result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTL landfill through the ways below:
- Burning CH4 in flares and/or group generators (implemented and running);
- Supply consumers through a dedicated pipeline (implemented and running);
- The amount of electricity generated in the project activity will be part used for self-consumption at CTL landfill facilities and the surplus part will be exported to the Brazilian national grid, avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil fueled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development (not implemented yet, but already included in the CDM Project).
It is important to highlight that currently the energetic use of the biogas in the project activity is through the selling of LFG to consumers (dedicated pipeline) and those consumers generates electricity to the grid. In the registered PDD is already contemplated one electricity generation plant which is not implemented yet by the project proponent, due to company internal arrangements as well as market conditions and products availability.
The landfill began its operation on 24 November 2010, receiving of household waste (Class II-A and II-B). The increased area of the landfill is 704.106 m² incorporated to the existent landfill area of 1.123.590 m². Thus, the total landfill area considering the increased area is 1.827.696 m². There is the possibility of increasing the waste disposal area, however this possibility will be analyzed in the future.
EcoUrbis Ambiental S.A.  is the company responsible for the implementation and operation of the CTL landfill and also, it is responsible, since October/2004, for collection services and disposal of solid waste in region East and South of the city of São Paulo (covering around 6,000,000 of inhabitants) under a concession for twenty years, renewable for another twenty years.

Furthermore, it is stipulated that these plantations are to be certified under a Voluntary Carbon Market certification scheme with the intent of producing carbon credits while creating climate impact.
The farms in question have been subject to logging of commercially valuable species since the 1970s. Subsequently, during the colonization of East Panama (Cañitas-Tortí 1970's and 1980's), the lands have been deforested and gradually degraded by repetitive slash-and-burn processes and conversion to pasture.
At the time of reforestation, the vegetation cover of the farms includes wooded pastures with native and improved grasses, as well as areas of stubble mostly in their different stages of development between 1-5 years of age. The only economic activity has been extensive cattle ranching in pasture areas. 
Furthermore, the project aims to improve the livelihoods of local populations, in special regards to women head-of-family, by incrementing their participation in the activities.

The use of firewood for daily cooking is not only one of the causes of deforestation but also indoor air pollution affecting directly or indirectly the health the women and children. There is also a marginal use of LPG in some households, due to the subsidy offered by the Indian government which does enable access to LPG but not continued usage.

Currently, most cooking in Togo is done with firewood and charcoal using traditional stoves such as three-stone fires and Malgache stoves. These inefficient stoves have significant impacts on health, forest degradation, and emission of greenhouse gases.  This project aims to enable the production and distribution of 200,000 improved cookstoves within 5 years, beginning in autumn 2022. Firewood users will have access to Himalayan cookstoves (produced by local potters using clay and other materials provided by the households themselves) and charcoal users will have access to Asuto cookstoves (portable stoves made up of a ceramic core and metal envelope). Evidence shows that these improved stoves can reduce fuel consumption by around 30%  compared to traditional stoves. The project targets households and artisans in the Plateaux, Maritime, and Centrale regions of Togo, which comprises about two-thirds to Togo’s total population. The cookstoves distributed through this project intend to be subsidized at 50% of the full price and come with a 5-year guarantee on potential defects. In addition to the distribution of subsidized cookstoves, the project will also support the local production of the stoves by identifying and providing technical and marketing training to 100 local potters and 30 local welders, as well as implement education and awareness activities on environmental and other benefits of improved cookstoves.

Taiwan is a biologically diversified island, in the past agriculture as the main production, now is dominated by high-tech, semiconductor and other industries, Taiwan still has millions of small farmers, responsible for the supply of 236 million Taiwanese main grain and small part of the export. Taiwan itself is an island with the earth's plates collided up, located on the Tropic of Cancer, with a land area of 36,000 square kilometers, 268 high mountains of more than 3,000 meters, high mountains and rapid rivers and streams, natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, heavy rainstorms, landslides, the soil is relatively poor, the soil lack of organic matters, the introduction of conventional agriculture for more than half a century, a large number of farmland soil acidified, lack of organic matter is common situation.

The use of the Gold Standard Global Goal’s Soil Organic Carbon Framework Methodology for Small Farmers’ Carbon Farming is able to encourage Taiwan's governments and farmers to adopt more environmentally sound, soil, food security, healthy farming practices for farmers and consumers, and more importantly, participate in global climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also motivates small farmers in action on the 17 goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Agricultural carbon sequestration, as if it is very important for small farmers to participate in global climate action, but small farmers lack resources, including finance, knowledge and experience, it is not easy to record, declare their working logs, so that the evidence of greenhouse gas emission reduction certification is difficult to be demonstrated. 

The Project Developer, the Eco-Affinity Inc., specially offers a set of smart phone applications for small farmers to do carbon farming called “MiHuMISang” adopted from  greetings of indigenous Bunun Tribe.  

Since smart phone, social media applications are popular, as long as farmers have the experience of taking photos, checking-in, post photos to share.  It is easy for small farmers to record their carbon project activities through encryption technology, the authentic photo files bundle with time stamps and geotags spontaneously that cannot be adulterated once they are uploaded to the database to form systematic big data to help small farmers achieve certification quality assurance and quality control (product and process QA/QC), and except personal confidential information, all data will be made public on the Internet for public participation and witness.  VVB is also easy to trace back to verify project activities, increase the credibility of certification, and preventing carbon leakage, double counting loopholes, and produce high-quality VERs.

This will not only apply to Taiwan, but also to small farmers around the world in the future, to promote more farmers and consumers to participate in climate action and achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

The project provides access to clean drinking water for rural households and directly replaces non-renewable biomass (fuelwood) burning at baseline that would have been otherwise used to boil water at baseline which is mainly sourced from the unimproved or unhealthy water sources under the baseline scenario. In line with the Gold Standard definition, an improved drinking-water source is one that by the nature of its construction and design adequately protects the source from outside contamination, in particular by faecal matter. The underlying assumption is that improved sources are more likely to supply safe drinking-water than unimproved sources.

In this regard, borehole and tube wells are considered as the project scenario under ‘Improved Water Sources’. This falls under the category of “Eligible community water supply technologies (CWS)” and thus the project creates direct impacts into the basic need of the rural lives through piped water into dwellings sourced from tubewell and/or borehole. Under the project activity, new boreholes and tubewells are being constructed as new water supply points for the households.

This revolutionary concentrate, rich in copper and precious metals enjoys a low environmental footprint by bypassing the traditional mining channels and instead tapping into the ever-growing e-waste urban mine.
 
Igneo has perfected a simple yet exceptionally effective recycling and recovery solution to transform and enhance the vast quantities of valuable e-waste that are currently left untreated, unrecycled, and often abandoned in landfill. The Igneo process employs a multi-stage model which fully captures the economic value held in e-waste:
* Sourcing of electronic waste from traders, collectors and OEMs and identifying valuable key PCB (printed circuit board) and other metal containing material;
* Crushing and shredding the e-waste into a normalized fraction for further processing and sampling;
* The resulting shredded material is automatically sampled and then analyzed at on-site lab to determine the valuable metals contents;
* Using automated mechanical separation technology, remove the iron and aluminum from the shredded fraction;
* The shredded material is heat-treated using a pyrolyzing multi-hearth furnace, which convert organic matter into a gas state while retaining all metals. The result is a    homogeneous concentrate containing copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum etc. (copper concentrate);
* The off gas generated from the pyrolysis process is processed through several stages of gas remediation, including a post combustion chamber resulting in the mitigation or complete elimination of all toxic pollutants including dioxins, NOx gases and halogens.
 
The proprietary Igneo process converts and upgrades e-waste into a concentrate which is higher in valuable recoverable metal content than most other traditional copper concentrates and for the most part free of organic matter, sulfur, and toxic materials which are harmful or cost prohibitive to the copper smelting and refining processes.

The Clean Energy LLC has wind farm a capacity of 49.6 MW and generate (net) 168.5 GWh of electricity per year.

On 25th June 2013, The Salkhit wind farm started commercial operation. The Salkhit wind farm generates renewable electricity using wind power resources and sells the generated output to the Central Energy System (CES, or the grid) on the basis of a power purchase agreement (PPA). In addition, the Salkhit wind farm also aims to lead renewable energy generation from wind in Mongolia, as the Salkhit wind farm was the first grid connected wind farm in Mongolia. The Salkhit wind farm generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO2 emissions from electricity generation by fossil fuel power plants that is supplied to Grid.

Thus, Salkhit wind farm installed capacity is 49.6 MW of renewable energy power generation and supplies to the Grid of 164 GWh of electricity generated from renewable energy annually.

A. Project scenario is the operation of 31 sets of wind turbines with a total capacity of 50MW which will supply an annual generation of 164GWh to grid and replace same amount of electricity generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants connected to grid. According to ACM0002 applied, the project is renewable electricity activity.
B. The baseline scenario of the project is the electricity supply of equal amount as the project from the grid. The baseline scenario of the project is the same as the scenario prior to the start of implementation of project activity.

The Project boundary included the project site and all power plants connected physically to the grid.

As the Grid is dominated by thermal power generation, the Salkhit wind farm activity is leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The second crediting period for the proposed project is from 24/06/2020 to 23/06/2027 and estimated emission reduction is in the second crediting period are 1,332,835tCO2e. The average annual emission reduction is estimated by 190,405 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) for the 2nd crediting period.

Sustainable development
As the very first wind farm in Mongolia the Salkhit wind farm is greatly assisting the country in stimulating the commercialisation of grid-connected renewable energy technologies and markets. The Salkhit wind farm is helping to reduce GHG emissions versus the coal-dominated business-as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the Salkhit wind farm is improving air quality and local livelihoods and promote sustainable renewable energy industry development.
The specific goals of the project are to:
• generate electricity;
• help to stimulate the implementation of wind power in Mongolia;
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Mongolia compared to a business-as-usual scenario;
• create local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and for operation of the wind farm;
• reduce other pollutants resulting from the power generation industry, compared to a business-as-usual approach, such as SO2 and soot.","190405","ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources","Large Scale","Standalone",""

The project will last 5 years and will be renewable twice, for a maximum period of 15 years.

The project's cookstove model is a metal-ceramic fireplace using wood. 

The benefits will be both environmental and social. On the social front, the project will create jobs, reduce smoke emissions including smoke inhalation diseases, and reduce the time spent cooking and collecting biomass because the project's cooking stove needs less biomass to function. From an environmental point of view, the project will reduce the impact on the forest by reducing wood collection and thus avoid carbon emissions.

The objective of this improved cookstove project is therefore to improve the health and well-being of households, mainly women and children in the project area, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions released by traditional cooking and water boiling activities. 
The owner of the project is APEDD, a Guinean NGO (Association of Women for Development) that promotes women's empowerment and environmental protection.
The standard chosen for this project is the Gold Standard and the methodology applied is the TPDDTEC (Technologies and Practices for Moving Decentralized Thermal Energy Consumption) V3.1.

LPG has significantly less environmental impact than other available fuels due to its source, combustion byproducts and yield. LPG is safer to transport and use and is precisely controllable by end-users – with known and consistent properties and minimal emissions of toxic byproducts. LPG does not emit soot (black carbon), smoke or dangerous fumes. The use of LPG stoves will be much more efficient than what is currently being used for cooking, thus requiring much fewer BTUs of fuel per meal. The result will be substantial reductions in both greenhouse gas and non-GHG pollution.

PayGo’s approach will be to use a Cylinder Smart Meter (CSM) system that enables a “pay as you go” service. The CSM contains a low-pressure LPG regulator, metering capabilities and a communications system. The product affixes to existing cylinder valves and enables customers to make small payments for LPG via the customer’s mobile money account.

"11815","Electric Cooking Program by ATEC ","ATEC Australia-International Pty Ltd","Gold Standard Certified Design","1,3,8,7,13","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","Cambodia","The proposed Program of Activities (Electric Cooking Program by ATEC) has been
developed by ATEC Australia-International Pty Ltd (ATEC*) with the purpose of replacing the use of highly polluting non-renewable and fossil fuels used for cooking by households within the project target areas. This will be achieved through the distribution and installation of ATEC PAYGO enabled eCook induction cookstoves. ATEC’s patented electric cookstove (eCook) is the world’s first Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) induction stove which is ATEC’s flagship product that brings 27 months ranged PAYGO facility, Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications and Internet of Things (IoT) functionality that makes mobile money payments easy for unbanked and underserved populations. 
The primary target are end-users who cook using polluting fuels in inefficient stoves in the baseline, yet are already connected to the grid. The use of electricity for cooking using highly efficient cooking appliances is expected to provide an affordable, convenient, and safe cooking solution to end-users. The program will also contribute towards sustainable development goals key among them being SDG 1,3,7 and 13. The first project activities are being implemented in Bangladesh and Cambodia.
The specific description of the Program of Activity is as follows:
a)	The Program of Activities (PoA) entails the distribution of an e-cooking solution among households especially those using biomass for cooking yet are connected to the grid. 
b)	The PoA is being developed and implemented by ATEC*, who will have the formal responsibility of coordinating the PoA and the included VPAs.
c)	ATEC* will work with local project implementers who will provide support in the management of the VPAs in respective countries. 
d)	The PoA is a voluntary action by the project developer and will apply the Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices in the calculation of emission reductions. 
The project will have social, economic, and environmental benefits and impacts across the following multiple areas:
•	Improved health: Using e-cooking solutions reduces the use of polluting fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and kerosene which disproportionately impacts women and children due to smoke and other household in-door air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. E-cooking provides a clean, safe and reliable cooking solution that will lead to significant improvement in indoor air quality in beneficiary households (SDG 3).
•	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass stoves consumes a lot of fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Using electricity for cooking will reduce CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
•	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional inefficient biomass stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to the constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The e-cooking technology being promoted by the project developer is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood, and the cooking time is shortened. This leads to productive use of time at home, especially for women who can venture into other income-generating activities and improve the quality of study time for children (SDG 4 & 5).
•	Money and Time savings: Most families using biomass fuels and kerosene for cooking spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy needs. ATEC seeks to target households who are connected to the grid but using biomass and kerosene for cooking, in the distribution of the units. Using the technology will provide meaningful time and money savings for these end-users (SDG 1).
•	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable clean energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through the e-cooking technology being promoted by the program (SDG 7).
•	Job creation: The program will create employment opportunities for many people in different phases of the program. These are expected to benefit locals and especially the youths who will be employed as part of sales and service teams, and the overall management of the program (SDG 8).

This project is located in Nowshera, KPK Province – one of the worst affected during the 2022 monstrous floods that impacted over 33 million Pakistanis. Bondh E Shams (Solar Water Project) has developed a solar-powered, water storage and filtration unit called the OASIS Box™. Each unit filters up to 10,000 liters of potable water daily and this project aims to serve approximately 142,000 people across 18,900 households.

Furthermore, the OASIS Box Sustainable Project utilizes a proprietary digital MRV mechanism to ensure industry-leading robust impact reporting. Each OASIS Box ™ is equipped with an IoT sensing and transmission network that utilizes internet connectivity to report data on 3 key parameters: geolocation, water output (litres per day) and water quality (total dissolved solids). All information is transmitted directly to a web portal and offset buyers get personalised access to their impact page.

By replacing traditional water boiling methods that rely on wood and biomass, each OASIS Box offsets approximately 272 tonnes of GHG emissions annually, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions while improving health outcomes. Co-benefits support multiple Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Sustainable Energy), and SDG 13 (Climate Action and will also generate local employment. This project is 100% additional and cannot be supported without climate financing.

Bondh E Shams (Solar Water Project) hopes to scale clean water projects across the world. Hence, this flagship project will be catalytic to global impact.

The use of firewood for daily cooking is not only one of the causes of deforestation but also indoor air pollution affecting directly or indirectly the health the women and children. There is also a marginal use of LPG in some households, due to the subsidy offered by the Indian government which does enable access to LPG but not continued usage.

The advanced design of the improved cookstoves allows quicker heating-up, less fuel use, high heat retention and lower quantities of combustion fumes. The use of the Boja stoves will result in the following benefits:
	Significant savings of charcoal and wood fuel costs
	Reduced indoor air pollution (IAP)
	Greenhouse gas emission reduction.

The project will be coordinated and implemented by CookClean Ghana Limited and will target the whole country of Ghana, starting with densely populated urban areas where charcoal consumption is high. The project will then expand to the wider peri-urban and rural areas where the utilization of wood fuel is high.

The project will disseminate, but not limited to, the BOJA improved stove which has been designed and manufactured by CookClean Ghana Limited.

The boundary covered by the large-scale project is the geographical boundary of Ghana.

The Boja stoves will displace baseline inefficient cooking devices that consume more non-renewable biomass.

The Project is a Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE) generation plant that will be developed in Ras Ghareb on the Gulf of Suez, Egypt, by an Independent Power Producer (IPP). The project is an alternative to dispatching existing and developing new, fossil fuel based and greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive, power generation plants connected to the electricity grid (the baseline situation). The substitution of the generation of more GHG intensive electricity will lead to GHG emission reductions that will be monitored during the lifetime of the project activity.


This project activity is a voluntary initiative of the project participants and Ras Ghareb Wind Energy SAE (RGWE) as the Project Developer. The relation between the Project Participants is based on a tender for the right to build, own and operate the project based on a Power Purchase Agreement with EETC. Ras Ghareb Wind Energy SAE, which is a consortium of ENGIE (France), Toyota Tsusho – Eurus (Japan) and Orascom Construction (Egypt), submitted a successful proposal and was awarded with the right to develop the project. The RGWE project will be connected to Egypt’s national grid and all its energy will be sold to EETC based on the tariff established by the auction process. The project achieved financial close on 14 December 2017, which is the date where construction agreements were enacted, and is expected to reach full commercial operations around 24 months later.


The project boundary includes the project power plant and each of its power units and all power plants/units physically connected to the same electricity grid that the power plant is connected to. The RGWE project is aligned with Egypt’s governmental policies to increase NCRE generation to 30% of total energy demand by 2035. To pursue this objective and the resulting GHG mitigation, Egypt has enacted diverse incentives and promotional policies and is planning to establish a national, or even regional, carbon market to attract foreign direct investment.","730788","ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources","Large Scale","Standalone",""

The VPA promotes improved cooking stoves (ICS) with natural or forced air draft in the remote rural households of Lumbini and Karnali provinces of Nepal. Displacement of less efficient traditional cooking stoves from kitchens will reduce exposure of the family members, specifically women, to the indoor air pollution and reduce drudgery related to firewood collection or cleaning of utensils. These benefits will help in saving of health expenses. Each ICS promoted under the VPA will reduce the consumption of non-renewable biomass thereby reducing emission of about 10,000 tCO2eq of greenhouse gases annually. Each stove disseminated under the project will have a useful life of five years and will potentially reduce the firewood consumption by more than half for comparable usages.","10000","GS MS Simplified Methodology for Efficient Cookstoves v1.","Micro Scale","VPA",""

A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution . The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions. ","114822","AMS-II.G.

Greenway operates a fully integrated business model that covers design, manufacturing, distribution and customer service. Greenway aims to replace traditional inefficient stoves with Greenway Stoves, which would deliver impact across multiple areas.

Cooking on traditional mud stoves (indoor open fires), using biomass, is a global problem affecting health, productivity and the environment. A large part of India’s population cannot use modern fuels such as electricity or cooking gas on account of access, affordability and availability. 
 
Traditional stoves consume significant amounts of fuel and emit dangerous smoke on account of their incomplete and inefficient combustion. The smoke emitted by traditional stoves is known to be one of the biggest health risks faced by women and children due to the presence of particulates. 

The project plans to distribute efficient cooking devices to domestic end users across India where the VPA will be located. The proposed VPA will have the whole of India as its project boundary. The location of the VPA is within the proposed PoA boundary.

This will be achieved through distribution and installation of LPG units that are fitted with a smart meter to track and monitor LPG usage by the end-users. The project adopts a Pay as You Go (PAYG) approach to accelerate access to LPG by the end-users. The project acitivity also aims to contribute towards sustainable development goals. The specific description of the project activity is as follows:
a)	The project entails distribution and installation of Pay as You Go LPG units that are made distinct by the unique smart meter developed by Circle Gas.
b)	The project developer is Circle Gas, who will have the formal responsibility of the Project activity.
c)	The VPA implementor for this project activity is M-Gas Kenya, and will be directly responsible for maintaining the sales database, collecting baseline information, and co-ordinating the annual monitoring process. 
d)	The project activity is a voluntary action by the project developer. 
e)	The goal of the project is to accelerate access to LPG especially among low-income households which will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with use of traditionally unsustainable fuels such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene.

The aim of the project activity is to replace traditional biomass (fuelwood and charcoal), and kerosene cookstoves used in the baseline, with LPG units which will deliver impacts across the following multiple areas:
•	Improved health: Using LPG reduces the use of dirty fuels such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene which disproportionately impacts on women and children due to smoke and other household air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. Household Air Pollution (HAP) is one of the largest health risk factors for mortality in Kenya with about 21,560 deaths attributed to HAP annually . Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of BC and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health (SDG 3).  
•	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass and kerosene stoves consumes more fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of black carbon and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health.Using LPG reduces CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
•	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional biomass inefficient stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The project technology is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood and cooking time is shortened. This leads to improved use of time at home especially for women who can venture in other income generating activities and give children more time for study (SDG 4 & 5).
•	Money and Time savings: Families spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy provision. The Circle Gas target market is the urban low-income population. Using the technology provides meaningful savings for customers while creating thousands of high-quality jobs (SDG 1).
•	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through implementation of this programme (SDG 7).
•	Job creation: the project will create employment to many people especially the youths who will be employed as field sales and service teams, and the overall management of the programme (SDG 8).

Additionally, this will also led to an increase in household income levels especially for female headed households and a significant reduction in health related disease affecting women. Women and the girl-child in rural communities are subjected to long hours in the bush fetching firewood for cooking and heating and in most cases, they have to walk long distances. The solar cooker project will help reduce indiscriminate cutting of trees for fuel wood for cooking and heating. The project has taken an integrated approach encompassing components such as reforestation. The integration model will help communities in the project area to have access to clean energy, promote sustainable forestry management, food security and climate resilient communities. This model will help promote access to renewable energy technologies as enshrined in the National Policy on Climate Change (2016). The project beneficiaries are encouraged to participate in tree planting activities, practicing sustainable farming methods and forest resources management.

The African Stove Company Ltd. (TASC) is the coordinating/managing entity (CME) of the PoA and is the sole implementer of the VPA. TASC’s mission is financing and developing high-impact climate mitigation projects. 
 
The VPA is an activity that was originally anticipated to be included as a CPA under a CDM PoA (6864: Fuel Efficient Stoves in Africa ) and is now transitioning from the CDM to the Gold Standard under the PoA GS11009: TASC Clean Cooking PoA. The VPA is therefore retroactive in nature, as the first ICS was distributed in Zambia on 26th August 2020. 

The VPA is implemented in communities Zambia where woodfuel is the primary source of energy for cooking and open, 3-stone fires are commonplace. 

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate emissions (PM), thus improving the indoor air quality in project households. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the 3-stone fires, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs.

In the absence of the proposed VPA, inefficient 3-stone fires are used for cooking and their replacement with project ICS reduces non-renewable biomass fuel consumption, saving greenhouse gas emissions.

At the time of VPA inclusion, there are 45,000 ICS planned for distribution under the VPA, of which c. 35,000 have been distributed and entered into the monitoring database. It is anticipated that the remaining ICS will be distributed by April 2021.","431949","GS TPDDTEC v3.1","Large Scale","VPA","11009"

The PoA aims to replace traditional stoves with high efficient cooking devices, which would deliver impact across multiple areas.
Cooking on inefficient cooking devices using biomass, is a global problem affecting health, productivity and the environment. A large part of the PoA boundary population cannot use modern fuels such as electricity or cooking gas on account of access, affordability and availability.  
Inefficient cooking devices consume significant amounts of fuel and emit dangerous smoke on account of their incomplete and inefficient combustion. The smoke emitted by traditional stoves is known to be one of the biggest health risks faced by women and children due to the presence of particulates.
For this reason, this proposed PoA aims at reducing the wood fuel consumption of inefficient cooking devices by distributing improved cook devices which reduce fuel consumption. To reduce deforestation and the emission of greenhouse gas within the PoA boundary, cooking devices being distributed will lead to use of less wood fuel or substitute it.
The PoA proposes to develop and commercialise the carbon assets from the distribution of various cooking devices (improved cook stoves, ethanol stoves, electric cookers, metered LPG, solar cookers amongst others) to replace baseline inefficient stoves.  The PoA will structured in away such that it can leverage on investor funding and carbon finance to support (subsidy) production and distribution. The investor funds would be supplemented with Carbon funds which will create a revolving fund to help in payment for the cooking devices and provide a loan facility to help more uptake of the cooking devices.","0","GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION","Small Scale","POA",""

Now, Fair Climate Fund (FCF), a Dutch organization based in Utrecht, The Netherlands in an agreement with tiipaalga association along with local communities/federation is developing 5 grouped VPAs (Voluntary Project Activities) that will cover the municipalities of Pô, Tiébélé and Gniaro in the Province of Nahouri and will seek inclusion under the registered gold standard PoA and later certify under Fairtrade Climate Standard. This VPA, being part of the 5 grouped VPAs, will be developed to implement clean, safe and energy efficient cooking stoves which will consume less firewood and reduce smoke in the cooking area. The project promotes the implementation improved cook stove which is a mud made 3 stones efficient woodstove “F3PA”. The improved cook stoves will replace traditional cooking stoves, which utilize firewood and charcoal. With this approach, the 5 VPAs will reach out to more than 10,000 households in the Province of Nahouri in Burkina Faso. This project seeks to increase access of rural communities to improved cook stoves by implementing F3PA mud stoves and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Burkina Faso. The improved cook stoves or F3PA mud stoves will be made of a mixture of clay mud, straw, dung of a donkey or cow and water. The stove will be constructed by locally available, inexpensive materials and its size will be customized as per the size of corresponding family. The project implementation will be done by imparting training to the local women in the rural areas. The technical and operational skill will be developed at local level which provides knowledge at household level on how to use and maintain the improved cook stoves. The implementation also includes component of education on hygienic usage and on the threat of climate change and health hazards related to the old cooking system and inform on the health and environmental benefits of using such efficient cook stoves. The proposed improved cook stove technology will create a positive impact on the environment and eligible for generating Gold Standard certified emission reduction units which will be later certified under Fairtrade Climate Standard.

The purpose of the project is to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves technology, with clean, sustainable and efficient biogas. Each household utilizes cow dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water. This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil conditions in rural areas.

"11052","Regenerate forest in Ethiopia: Support Carbon sequestration & wellbeing of families ","World Vision Finland","Gold Standard Certified Design","8,15,5,13","A/R","Ethiopia","Ethiopia is one of the most disaster-prone countries in Africa exposing the population to famine and loss of property and livestock. Any success in socio-economic development is put at risk because of regular droughts and floods while land degradation is one of the major contributing factors. Loss of vegetation and deforestation due to increased demand for land, pasture and wood, especially firewood, exposes the soil to erosion. Vast areas of Ethiopia have decreased their soil fertility and agricultural value aggravated by climate change and erratic rainfall patterns. 
 
World Vision Ethiopia will support local communities of Kindo Koyisha, Offa and Shashemene in Southern Ethiopia to become more resilient to climate change impacts. The project involves the restoration of degraded lands through the regeneration of several indigenous tree species in mountainous regions of South Western Ethiopia. By undertaking these reforestation activities, the project will contribute to climate change mitigation by removing atmospheric carbon due to the reforestation activities.   
 
The project gives special emphasis to involving the wider community through organizing the community into voluntary community-based institutions to ensure the communities have ownership of the project. Moreover, increased participation in the sustainable use and conservation of natural resources is achieved through awareness creation, providing user-rights certification for the forest areas within the project, capacity building and empowering, sustainable generation of income from carbon credits and utilization of forest and non-forest products by the communities.  
 
The project applies the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) Technique to reforest degraded lands (https://fmnrhub.com.au/fmnr-manual/). 
 FMNR is an empowering form of social forestry which gives individuals and communities both responsibility for care and nurture of naturally occurring woody vegetation and rewards from sustainable harvesting of wood and non-timber forest products. The main components of FMNR are awareness creation for all partners working at ground level; advocacy for favorable policy environment; adequate follow up and encouragement and organizational structure such as forestry cooperatives. FMNR has a significant positive impact on income, food security, disaster resilience and reduction of conflict and is a significant tool for both climate change adaptation and mitigation. It has proven to have a positive effect from small scale to landscape, as a means of restoring degraded land, reversing desertification, enhancing ground water recharge and contributing to reforestation.  In addition to FMNR, land that cannot be restored by natural means because of the lack of living stumps and soil seed banks will be reforested by enrichment planting. Nurseries are established within local communities and focus on production of native and naturalized seedlings.

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, improving indoor air quality in project households/SMEs. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the traditional/baseline stoves, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs. 
In the absence of the proposed PoA, inefficient traditional / 3-stone fires /charcoal pots would have been used for cooking. Thus, replacement of the baseline inefficient stoves with project ICS shall reduce non-renewable biomass fuel consumption and hence equivalent amount of GHG emissions.

The Program addresses two drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light. As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing 50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by local communities. The project scope is including, but not limited to the distribution of solar lamps for school kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove technologies.

of greenhouse gas emissions and the improvement of the socio-economic situation of
households in East African countries, especially in Ethiopia. The Program addresses two
drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based
lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy
efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the
project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the
respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa
cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often
help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their
attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete
darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute
to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light.
As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as
well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful
to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved
stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing
50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally
carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also
emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the
program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their
development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by
local communities.

Scrap.); the American Standards INSTITUTE OF SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES INC, as well as to the Directives and the European Environmental Regulations (Regulation 333/2011 establishing the conditions under which certain aluminum and iron wastes are no longer considered as waste). 
The technologies used by AS METAL COM SRL allow us to recover and separate metal waste with a fraction mass mainly of aluminum resulting from the processing of secondary aluminum raw materials and other ferrous and non-ferrous metal substances which in turn are put on the market in accordance with the industry standards that govern them. Our technological processes guarantee a high recovery efficiency not only through the reported quantities but especially through their quality. 

The output capacity of the aluminum recycling plant is given by the types of processed waste and is between 49.000 up to 77.500 tons/year. 
The project activity is located on the industrial platform of AS METAL of 35,000 sqm. in the southern part of Bucharest, capital of Romania.

The main goal of the project is the reduction of CO2 emissions through aluminum recycling, displacing the primary aluminum production from raw materials (mined minerals, bauxite). In the case of primary aluminum production from raw materials, the process has a much greater consumption of energy and therefor a much higher environmental impact regarding CO2 emissions.

The activity of the project is a model for other similar aluminum recycling facilities in Romania and Eastern Europe, which deliver sustainable development. Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements and with the European circular economy (aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources) directives.

By tapping into the voluntary carbon markets to monetise the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions achieved by the programme, the price of the solar lights will be subsidised so that every household can afford them. Over a short period of time, the use of solar lights will result in direct savings from expenditures on kerosene, candles, or batteries used for lighting.

This is achieved through the installation and operation of solar PV systems replacing fossil fuel-powered equipment.
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the Moroccan economy. In many areas, precipitation levels are low, meaning that agricultural activity can only be sustained through irrigation. Inefficient pumping and irrigation systems have contributed to the decline of groundwater levels in Morocco, threatening soil fertility. Farmers without access to grid electricity usually power their pumping systems with diesel and butane gas, which they often source over long distances. Furthermore, they are dependant on fossil fuel prices.
This project allows farmers to become independant of fossil fuels through the hire purchase of a PV system, which they pay off over a period of 6 years. This does not create extra costs for farmers but instead saves them money, as they no longer need to purchase fuel. In order to obtain a PV system through this project, farmers are required to switch to a water-efficient drip irrigation system. Beyond reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the project thus helps to promote resource-efficient and sustainable agriculture.","7537","AMS-I.A.

The purpose of the project is to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves technology, with clean, sustainable and efficient biogas. 

Each household utilizes cattle dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water.  This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas. 
Project activity will contribute towards sustainable development by replacing firewood with biogas generated from the biodigesters.

The use of non-renewable woody biomass contributes to deforestation and emits a lot of toxic smoke. Gas represents an alternative energy to the use of woody biomass for the cooking needs of households and street food vendors. Promoting the use of this energy therefore makes it possible to transfer household energy demand to another fuel, thus easing the pressure on the vegetation cover. In addition, gas cooking significantly reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) and fine particle emissions, thus contributing to the fight against climate change. Gas cooking also has a health impact, as it considerably reduces the inhalation of harmful fumes by users, while providing incomparable cooking comfort. Mivo Energie aims to remove these barriers to adoption of this clean and economical cooking method by developing networks for the distribution of quality equipment and gas refills, and by setting up innovative financial services to facilitate access for vulnerable households.","28127","GS TPDDTEC v3.1","Large Scale","Standalone",""

The kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and subsequently into electrical energy. Kinetic energy which is carried by wind when passes through the blades of the WTG, is converted to mechanical energy which rotates the connected generator and which in turn produces the electricity. The electricity thus produced will be displacing the grid electricity which would have been otherwise generated through sources dominated by fossil fuel based power plants. The project activity thereby reduces the emission of green house gases which would have been generated from such fossil fuel based power plants. The electricity generation from the project activity will contribute to GHG reductions estimated at 11,568 t CO2e annually, while 115,680 t CO2e over period of 10 years. ","11435","AMS-I.D.

The PoA is a voluntary action with a goal of providing solutions that will reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with the use of non-renewable fuel from cooking at household levels. The use of non-renewable fuel such as wood and charcoal for cooking, leads to the emission of greenhouses gases, deforestation, and poor indoor climate. The programme will use several different technologies to reach this goal.  The solutions are based on two concepts that fall under the same CDM methodology: 	 
1.	Reduce the need for boiling water for drinking and thus reduce the need for non-renewable fuel for boiling water. This is achieved by providing clean and safe drinking water to participating households. The purified water is provided either through
a.	Water purification system provided at the household level or b.	Community-based water purification system where the households will get the purified water at water stations.  
 2. Provide clean renewable fuel for cooking and thus eliminate the need for non-renewable fuel consumption for cooking. This is done by providing highly efficient stoves that are using renewable fuel. The renewable fuel can either be:  
c.	Denatured alcohol or 
d.	Biogas.  
However, for this project, the specific focus is on the provision of clean renewable fuel for cooking and this will entail the distribution of denatured alcohol (ethanol) stoves in Kenya. 
The project has been registered with the UNFCCC, the reference number 7359.  The POA covers 19 African countries but for this Sub-POA, the host country is Kenya. The Sub-POA is comprised of 3 CPAs (CPAs 0027,0034 and 0047).

The traditional cooking methods also produce a lot of smoke which exposes the local families to respiratory diseases, particularly women and girls who are responsible for cooking activities, but also in young children and other people (e.g. the elderly) who spend a lot of time near the cooking devices. The use of inefficient cooking methods also have unintentional negative impacts on the environment as the fuel sourcing causes stress for the local forest resources and as the biomass burning causes greenhouse gas emissions.

The project will be attempting to address these issues by selling energy efficient cookstoves to households across the project intervention area at subsidized cost. The energy efficient stoves will allow households to cook the same amount of food using less firewood. ","10000","GS MS Simplified Methodology for Efficient Cookstoves v1.","Micro Scale","VPA","5658"

The Standard Practice is to keep the rice fields constantly flooded which results in prevalence of anaerobic soil bacteria. These produce Methane which is a greenhouse gas which makes rice cultivation into one of the factors with the highest short term potential to influence global heating.If the rice fields are not flooded constantly and the surface of the fields are allowed to fall dry from time to time, the emittance of Greenhouse Gases, especially Methane will be reduced considerably.  

The core focus of the project is to reduce the production of Greenhouse Gases and this will be achieved by introducing the so called Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) Practice on a large scale and verifying the application of AWD.

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

The purpose of the project is to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves technology, with clean, sustainable and efficient biogas. 
Each household utilizes cattle dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water.  This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non-renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the biodigesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas.

"2913","BaumInvest Reforestation Project ","BaumInvest AG","Gold Standard Certified Project","8,15,5,13","A/R","Costa Rica","BaumInvest has implemented a pioneering reforestation project in northern Costa Rica that combines ecological sustainability with social responsibility. The project focuses on transforming degraded pasturelands, previously used for extensive cattle ranching, into thriving forests of tropical hardwoods using a proven, nature-based approach. These mixed stands primarily consist of native species alongside teak, promoting biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.

Spanning four reforestation sites in remote northern Costa Rica, the project covers a total area of 1,527 hectares, with 978 hectares certified under the Gold Standard for reforestation. Approximately 20% of the project area remains untouched as old-growth and secondary forest, as well as wetlands, which serve as crucial habitats and biological corridors for endangered species. These include the diminishing Atlantic lowland rainforest fauna, such as the majestic Great Green Macaw. One of the project’s areas, La Virgen, is situated near Braulio Carrillo National Park, further enhancing its ecological significance.

Managing the reforested areas sustainably is a key priority of the project, which includes the practice of selective harvesting. This method ensures that timber extraction is carefully controlled to minimize environmental impact, protect forest integrity, and promote natural regeneration. By selectively harvesting individual trees rather than clear-cutting large areas, the project not only supports long-term forest health and biodiversity but also enhances carbon sequestration, reinforcing its commitment to ecological stewardship.

Additionally, the project is situated within two UNESCO-recognized biosphere reserves, 'Agua y Paz' and 'Cordillera Volcánica Central,' underscoring its global environmental importance. By restoring these ecosystems, the initiative contributes to preserving and increasing biodiversity while combating deforestation in a highly sensitive region.
Beyond its environmental goals, the BaumInvest project prioritizes socio-economic benefits for the local communities. It generates secure, long-term employment with fair working conditions, fostering a sustainable livelihood for people in this rural area. Active community involvement is encouraged, and wherever possible, resources and products needed for the reforestation are sourced locally, supporting regional economic development and strengthening the local value chain.","10602","Afforestation/Reforestation GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Methodology","Micro Scale","Standalone",""

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.","42222","AMS-II.G.

The installed capacity of the plant is 8 MWel. The fuel used is primarily mustard crop residue (MCR), which is abundantly available in the vicinity of the site. The electricity generated is exported to the northern regional grid, replacing a mixture of primarily coal and gas based power generation and thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The (MCR) are mainly bought from farmers of the surrounding villages of the Tonk plant site. The MCR is a new income for the farmers that was unexplored before the start of the project activity as the MCR was mainly burnt or left for decay on the fields in the past. Since the amount of biomass bought from the farmers is not limited, even families with a low amount of MCR are allowed to deliver to the plant. Furthermore, the deliveries to the plant are shared by several families. In this way, the wealth is widely spread throughout the local society. ","50002","AMS-I.D.

The total GHG emission reductions for the 10 years crediting period (2016-2025) are estimated at 453,800 t CO2. The estimated annual average GHG emissions reduction is 45,380 t CO2/year.
Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements because it contributes to local environmental sustainability, since recycling instead of using material from virgin inputs decreases the overall energy use, GHGs and environmental burden caused by natural resources extraction.
At the same time, PET waste recycling reduces the amount of waste to be disposed in the landfill. The project also contributes towards better working conditions and better revenue distribution to improve local and regional economic development, increases employment opportunities in the area; it contributes to the development of new technologies, to regional integration and connection with other sectors, and to a large extent to the local municipalities’ funds for social insurance, such as health and pension funds, and to local and social community development.","45380","AMS-III.AJ.

The applied technology is a ceramic water filter that produces water of safe drinking water quality which is further described in section A.5 below.Prior to the implementation of the proposed project, in the proposed project boundary there is limited access to clean drinking water. Lack of ready access to a water source also limit the quantity of suitable drinking water that is available to a household. Even if the water is obtained from an improved source, water that must be fetched from a source that is not readily accessible to the household and may be contaminated during transport or storage . Nationally, boiling water prior to drinking is the most common treatment method (70.1 percent of total population). The percentage of urban people and rural people boiling water is 60.0 percent and 80.1 percent, respectively . The baseline scenario is the continuation of current practice, thus identical to the existing scenario prior to the implementation of the proposed project.Under the project scenario, the proposed project will reduce GHG emissions by replacing the use of non-renewable biomass or fossil fuel to boil water to purify the water for drinking purposes. This purification method is energy intensive, creates indoor air pollution that is damaging to health, and emits significant GHG. Thus, the project activity contributes to the reduction in the GHG gas emissions associated to fossil fuel combustion for obtaining safe drinking water (SDW) as per conventional methods of water purification and also provides access to SDW to the consumers at an affordable price.

Boreholes/wells may be dysfunctional e.g. due to a broken or removed pump or other broken parts like plunger, chain or rising main. The rehabilitation of those boreholes/wells reduces the need for households to boil water as a means of purification. New boreholes might be drilled in case that this would reveal to be more favourable than rehabilitating boreholes/wells. 
Many existing boreholes in the districts of Rusizi, Ngoma, Rwamagana and Bugesera have fallen into disrepair because of lack of systematic maintenance programmes and due to insufficient financial means in the districts. The project aims to repair and maintain around 50 boreholes/wells  across the 4 districts. Any borehole/pump technology can be involved in the project activity. However, it is foreseen that the most common technologies will be of Afridev or India Mark. 
The rehabilitated boreholes/wells will be properly maintained in form of both preventive and corrective maintenance and water coming from the water points will be periodically tested for E.coli bacteria in order to guarantee safe and clean water over the time. 
It is planned to establish a WASH committee for each borehole.

The proposed project is located in the Southern Power Region and has been conceived for harnessing the power potential of left flank of the branch anicut in the Godavari River in Khammam District. This project involves the installation of six Horizontal Pit type full Kaplan turbines & generating units of 4 MW each to generate 24MW of power utilizing a rated head of 4.8m and a design discharge of 601.02m3 (Please refer to section A.4.3 for further technical details). 
The project activity is a Greenfield project planned on the Godavari River. Thus, the scenario existing prior to the implementation of this project activity would be to allow the potential energy in the flowing river to go untapped. In the absence of the project activity, any existing power demand in the region would be met by the continued operation of fossil fuel based power plants in the grid. Hydropower is a clean, renewable source of energy and does not contribute to air or water pollution or the emissions of greenhouse gases. The water after powering the turbines will be discharged back into the Godavari River through a tailrace canal, located within the river course close to the left bank open channel. 
The objective of the proposed project is to generate power from harnessing the water to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the Southern region of India. The generated power will be exported to the Southern regional grid via the sub-station at Bhadrachalam. The project is expected to export 100,300 MWh of energy per year to the grid. However, the project is commissioned and it is found that the generation in a year reached high is about 45801 MWh owing to various reasons. Hydro power plants are considered to be zero emission power sources. The project activity will displace the fossil fuel fired power generation from the grid and hence contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases.
 The baseline scenario relates to the export of electricity to the grid by the operation of grid connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project activity","42135",,"Large scale","Standalone",""

The different models and/or different sizes of IICS are either manufactured by the local stove manufacturer and project participant (PP) Virunga Engineering Works (u) Limited (VEW) or purchased from other manufacturers. As schools and institutions move up in the energy ladder, and fuel briquettes made of agricultural residues become available in Uganda, these IICS could also be used with such fuel briquettes in the future. In the case that a school/institution/IICS will use briquettes made of renewable biomass (agricultural residues and/or firewood from renewable plantations), the PP will ensure that no emission reduction credits will be claimed from the fuel switch from non-renewable to renewable biomass but only from the fuel savings resulting from the introduction of the IICS. The IICS are both portable as well as fixed built-in types, serving schools and other institutional users like prisons, plantation estates and hospitals. These IICS are more efficient in transferring heat to the saucepans, and as such, IICS require less biomass fuel to perform an equivalent cooking task when compared to the baseline technology. This increase in efficiency  translates directly to the  large scale fuel savings over the traditional stoves currently in use. By reducing fuel consumption, the project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the use of biomass fuels. This reduction in fuel consumption is estimated and corresponding CO2 emission reductions are calculated from these savings. The project activity shall initially deploy the VEW rocket stove IICS of 300 liters saucepan capacity to schools and institutions, but may distribute other saucepan capacities and/or models of IICS that meet the minimum thermal efficiency requirement of 20% later on. The different IICS sizes are conditioned by the saucepan capacity and range from 30 liters and up to 450 liters.","47745","AMS-II.G.

The working mechanism of heat retaining cooking is simple. The pot containing the food is brought to the boiling point. The temperature accumulated by the pot and its contents at the boiling point is enough to continue and end the cooking process in an insulated environment. The initial type of HRC technology that will be used is the “Wonder Cooker” (WC). Wonder Cookers are bags made of cotton fabric that establish the insulated environment through the use of small polystyrene beads sewn into compartments of the bag.

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution .  The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions.","22271","AMS-II.G.

As a result we planned to make use of the Clean Development Mechanism Gold Standard (GS) certification and project in order to promote improved cook stoves (SAVE 80), in the area of operation of SMARTD, i.e. in the entire district of Qacha’s Nek and in the rural areas of Quthing and Mohale’s Hoek which are Seforong in the Quthing district, Hloahloeng, Sebaretlane, Qabanyane and Qabane in the Mohale’s Hoek district. The improved cook stove can be used by households, which are using mainly fuel wood as their source of fuel. The SAVE 80, stove set promoted by SMARTD contains a stainless steel stove, three cooking pots with lids and a heat retaining container/wonder cooker. This stove uses only small brittle sticks/twigs of wood to cook or boil water. It saves up to 80% of fuel wood compared to ordinary open fire way of cooking. This means that if you would need 1.5kg of wood to boil 6litres of water on an open fire, with SAVE 80 you would only need 0.3kg.The stove is suitable for cooking, frying and water heating. After reaching boiling point, food can be transferred to the wonder cooker where it will continue to simmer until it is well cooked. This further reduces wood consumption. Besides preventing greenhouse gas emissions, the objectives of the planned CDM Gold Standard programs are:•To reduce wood consumption to a sustainable level so as to allow natural recovery of forests and/or reforestation to take place.•To reduce soil erosion and protect the environment.•To reduce indoor air pollution wood smoke and avoid its harmful health consequences.•To reduce time for wood collection for households.•To contribute to the prevention of wood resources so as to avoid inter-communal conflicts over resources.•To empower participating women groups in villages by including them in project activities.•To reduce vulnerability of households falling into poverty through decreasing fuel wood scarcity.Thanks to the income that will be generated through certification of the project under the Gold Standard, the high quality improved cook stoves can be sold at a reduced price to make them affordable to the average households.

"4424","African Cookstoves and Water Programme PoA","Likano Project Development GmbH","Gold Standard Certified Design","3,15,13","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","Rwanda","Biomass, principally firewood and charcoal, holds huge importance in Rwanda, accounting for a significant proportion of energy consumption. Biomass is often the predominant source of energy for cooking and water boiling, especially in rural areas. Cooking is generally carried out on thermally inefficient traditional devices and produces large amounts of smoke and indoor air pollution. The distribution of efficient cook stoves in this Programme will significantly reduce fuel consumption, resulting in an improved living environment for recipients and reduced pressure on local forests, with a reduction in fuel being burnt annually as a result of the project. By reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from combustion of non-renewable biomass will be correspondingly reduced. In addition more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water and a high percentage these boil their water to purify it for consumption, taking significant amounts of fuel and time. In addition to distributing improved cook stoves, this PoA will also introduce safe water technologies such as boreholes. Clean water technologies avoid the need for water to be treated by boiling, equating to a reduction in CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass. Boreholes will either be newly installed or repaired and returned to working order but in all cases will be maintained throughout the project life time. Using the concept of suppressed demand, project developers can also obtain credits by supplying clean water to poorer members of society that are not able to use biomass energy to treat their water (usually because they cannot afford it, or because the energy is otherwise unavailable to them). This means that the credits obtained are proportional to the amount of biomass that would have been combusted using traditional technology in order to provide clean water for users. This concept allows for beneficiaries who would otherwise not benefit from the project to be included and supplied with a safe water source.","0","GS TPDDTEC v 1.","Microscale","POA",""

Its energy efficient stand-alone project activity registered with the Clean Development Mechanism and the Gold Standard is capable of bringing a cleaner, healthier and environmentally friendly technology to low-income individuals, especially women and children, by changing the traditional cooking practices used in schools in Uganda. Simoshi outsources institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) from the local manufacturer Ugastove and promotes and sells them to schools and institutions. The behavioural transformation Simoshi brings to schools through an effective management of change and subsequent support to the continuous use of the IICS enables both the participating schools and Simoshi to recycle a percentage of the stream of carbon credit returns, to further expand the number of schools that move up in the energy ladder.
Simoshi sells the IICS through payment schemes that include instalment modalities, allowing schools to comfortably pay back their debt throughout the school year, using the money saved from firewood NOT consumed to pay back for the acquired IICS. 
Simoshi's strong relationship of trust built with schools through monitoring, on-going staff training and free annual IICS maintenance, are the added on value and innovative project's pillars necessary for the behavioural transition to happen. IICS is a product that is prone to rapid deterioration if not maintained regularly. Nevertheless the annual free service provided to the IICS and the school is crucial in shaping future customer relations, product expectations and ultimately behavioural change. Schools face tremendous financial constrains and attention to the kitchen environment is the least of their priorities. Nevertheless, they play a crucial role in the school finances, the health impact for children and cooks, the deforestation impact and subsequent CO2 emissions","30072","AMS-II.G.

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri.

Excess electricity is supplied to the grid.The main purpose of the project is to transform the existing low tech sludge treatment processat Kubratovo into a modern advanced treatment process matching the best sludge treatmentpractice available in Western Europe. This transformation has a major effect on the environmentthrough dramatically reducing the existing methane gas emissions at the plant while alsoreducing the volume of sludge (to as much as 50%) that needs to be transported, hencereducing GHG emissions from transportation as well (not included in GHG abatementcalculations).The overall objective of the project is to provide an environmentally friendly sludge treatmentprocess reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions that – under a business-as-usualscenario – would have continued.Other objectives are:• replace the traditional sludge drying beds and landfill options with mesophilic digestion ofall primary and secondary sludge followed by mechanical dewatering in order to reduceGHG emissions;• effectively mitigate odour problems from the existing treatment of sludge and sludgeliquors through introduction of digestion;• production of fertiliser by mechanical dewatering of the digested stabilised sludge;• production of electricity from utilisation of the biogas in CHP gas engines therebyreducing GHG emissions from electricity production by the grid.The project delivers the following key results:• all primary and secondary sludge thickened and digested as per EU recommendationsand guidelines;• all biogas produced within the digestion process used for power and heat generation viaCHP gas engines thus reducing on-site electricity purchases from the national grid;reduction in on-site fossil fuel usage as all site-heating requirements will be met by theCHP gas engines;• all sludge is stabilised and pathogen free.Long term strategic reductions of GHG emissions include:• reduction in open release of CH4 from open anaerobic sludge tanks and drying beds;• reduction in open release of CH4 from landfill disposal site;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of electricity production from fossil fuels;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of heat generation from fossil fuels.The project had been implemented in two stages:- Erection of a new digester system consisting of 4 digesters, 7,000 m3 each, designed,supplied and erected by PASSAVANT ROEDIGER Anlagenbau.For destroying of the excess methane in case of emergency a flaring system have beenimplemented, consisting of 2 x DN150 flares, type ZA1-F2-0/N0 designed andmanufactured by HEGWEIN GmbH, Germany.- Erection of 3 new co-generation sets GE JMS 320 GS-B.LC with 1,063 kW electriccapacity each and 1,088 kW thermal capacity, for generation of electric and thermalenergy by combusting biogas from digesters.The digesters were commissioned at the end of 2006 and started operation on 01 January 2007but due to some technical problems in the adjustment of the biological process the generation ofbiogas was interrupted in the end of June 2007 and resumed on 01 May 2008, so the firstindustrial quantities of biogas were registered in May, 2008.The CHP was commissioned and started generating electricity and thermal energy for plant’sneeds in November, 2009.","61769","AMS-I.C.

To have access to clean water, Guineans are harvesting wood from local forests and mangroves.  This wood is burned to boil the water to make it safe to drink.  Through this practice, carbon and other particulate matter are released into the environment. 
 
Project Blue seeks to eliminate the current carbon-emitting and deforestation practices through use of a gravity-fed, water filter that eliminates virtually all harmful bacteria.  These highly-durable filters easy to use and have a long life span for repeated use, which will encourage adoption and also limit the environmental impact.  
 
Additionally, the country's women carry on the brunt of the activities associated with collecting and burning wood. Since the filtration project would largely eliminate the need for such activities, women are then freed to engage in activities that will improve their status, such as becoming educated or engaging in other gainful activities. Indeed,  because of social dynamics within the locales where the project will take place, it is anticipated that women will comprise the overwhelming majority of the workforce that handles the distribution and administration of the filtration project.

The project is owned and operated by Hanbao Livestock & Farming Products Company, Ltd. and implemented on their pig farm in Fangyuan Township, Changhua County, Taiwan. The project involves the capture of biogas from the pig farm’s wastewater treatment facility and the construction of a biogas generation plant to utilize the recovered biogas for electricity production. The project also involves the installation of wind turbines and solar PV. Currently, the biogas generation plant has an installed capacity of 65KW with another 195kw to be installed, for an installed capacity of 260KW. Currently, the solar PV system has an installed capacity of 963KW with another 490KW to be installed, for an installed capacity of 1,453KW. The project will also involve the construction of wind turbines with an installed capacity of 51KW. Thus, the current installed renewable energy capacity is 1,028KW and the future total installed capacity will be 1,764KW. The completed project will produce an estimated 3,776MWh annually. Social and Environmental Benefits(1) Reduced methane emissions – Methane-rich biogas is a byproduct of waste decomposition. In the absence of the project, GHG emissions in the form of methane would be released directly into the atmosphere. The project will prevent methane emissions by capturing the biogas associated with pig waste treatment. (2) Renewable energy generation – The use of wind, solar, and biogas generated electricity neither creates water and air pollution not does it contribute to global climate change. Another benefit of domestic renewable energy is the decreased dependence on increasingly expensive imported fuel, most of which is highly polluting fossil fuel.","11835","AMS-I.D.

"3434","GS3434 Uberlândia landfills I and II","Energas Geracao de Energia Ltda","Gold Standard Certified Project","3,7,13","Biogas - Electricity","Brazil","The objective of the Uberlândia landfills I and II is to collect the landfill gas produced in the Uberlândia Landfill and use it to generate electricity. A total capacity of 2.80 MW will be installed, composed by 2 engines with individual capacity of 1.4 MW each. The project is expected to export 354,968  MWh during its lifetime.Uberlândia Landfill comprises two adjoining solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), named Landfill I and Landfill II, both owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. (Project Participant). The Landfill I started operating in July of 1995 and stopped receiving waste in September 2010. The Landfill II started operating in October 2010 with the same environmental care applied to the previous disposal site and counts on a qualified and multidisciplinary team of technicians. The landfill has a total area of 300,000 m2, with 200,000 m2 dedicated to disposal of waste, being able to receive till 4,500,000 m3 of solid waste for an approximately 18 years of lifetime. All the area was sealed with a membrane of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and compacted clay in order to protect the phreatic layer from contamination. The leachate generated in each landfill is given a different treatment. For Landfill I the leachate is treated at an ascendant flow anaerobic reactor followed by an anaerobic filter and then sent to the Uberabinha’s sewage treatment station (ETE Uberabinha) through municipal canalization. The leachate from Landfill II, after being analysed by the Municipal Department of Water and Sewage (Departamento Municipal de Água e Esgoto – DMAE), was authorized to be directly sent to the ETE Uberabinha without previous treatment. In this Project the Landfill I and the Landfill II were considered as a sole SDWS, since the area surrounding the two sites, including them, is owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and they are physically near enough to permit the joint operation. In fact, only a 27 m width road used exclusively for the landfilling operation separates the two sites, and the gas station and power plant of the proposed project activity are planned to be installed on the roadside between the Landfill I and Landfill II. Therefore, the estimative of emissions of methane from SWDS considered the two sites as one single SWDS.The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the Uberlândia landfills I and II project activity at the Uberlândia Landfill is the operation of the landfill with uncontrolled emission of the LFG (landfill gas) generated to the atmosphere, i.e. the LFG generated due to the decomposition of the organic matter is vented through the vertical wells installed at the landfill’s area. As will be demonstrated ahead, the existing scenario and the baseline scenario are the same.Emissions associated with the baseline scenario are the CH4 emissions due to the atmospheric release of the LFG and CO2 emissions due to the power generation from fossil-fuel power-plants. With the implementation of the project, the LFG previously released will be collected through the installation of pipelines and emission reduction will be achieved through the destruction of the gas collected in a flaring system and in the power plant. Additionally, the project will export renewable electricity to the grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of electricity from fossil-fuel based power plants in the Brazilian National Grid.The project will bring benefits to sustainable development, as follows:-Increase of local environmental quality: the project will contribute not only through the avoidance of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, but also by displacing the fossil fuel consumption from power plants connected to the Brazilian Electric Grid. The project might also be seen as a good practice of correct solid waste final disposal;-Labour capaciting / Income generation: the project will need qualified operators to maintain the gas collection wells and pipeline and to operate the degassing station and the power plant. A team composed by engineers and technicians will be created and trained by international consultants and manufacturers. The revenues of these personnel will be above the market, as the technology employed is new in the Uberlândia region;-Integration with different sectors: using LFG to generate electricity is relatively new in Brazil – some projects were developed only under the CDM and only a few of them are indeed generating electricity (like the Bandeirantes Landfill Gas to Energy Project, São João Landfill Gas to Energy Project and Exploitation of the biogas from Controlled Landfill in Solid Waste Management Central – CTRS / BR.040). Therefore, the project will have an enormous contribution over the integration with the electric sectors.Project start date: 03/05/2011This is the date of creation of Energas Geração de Energia Ltda., composed by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and Asja Brasil Serviços para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. exclusively for the development of the Project.","218407","ACM0001 Flaring or use of landfill gas","Large Scale","Standalone",""

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri.

Mahasakthi Cooperative Federation encourages independent, sustainable and viable alternative economic institutions of women focussing on women’s leadership, their legal rights and political empowerment. The purpose of the project activity is to set up 6,000 biogas plants (digesters) of 2m3 capacity each for single households having minimum of two cows and place to build biogas digester in four Mandals of Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, and in this way replace Non-Renewable Biomass with biogas for cooking and heating water. A biogas plant of 2 m3 capacity is sufficient to provide cooking fuel to a family of four to five . Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh State is a biomass deficit region . Fuel wood scarcity has an impact directly on rural households, which are highly dependent on this fuel. Demand for fuel wood and logs from commons and forests have caused resource degradation to the extent that collection exceeds sustainable yield. Forest degradation on the other hand leads to fuel wood scarcity leading to unsustainable removal of biomass to meet the demands. The project activity will attenuate the rural thermal energy needs used for cooking and water heating. Each household will install a 2 m3 biogas plant and cattle dung will be put into the anaerobic digester (Deenabandhu biogas Model). The technology is tried and tested in India , and has been in use for many years.

"2564","Expanding access to LPG in Haiti through microfinance services","Entrepreneurs du Monde","Gold Standard Certified Project","3,7,13","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","Haiti","In Haiti more than 90% of the population cooks on charcoal-based stoves and do so using so called traditional ones. Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS Enèji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS Enèji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS Enèji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  “Expanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fighting  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  gas  such  as  carbon  monoxide  inside households. Indeed, the combustion of charcoal with traditional stoves, generates toxic gas in the air.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cook stove,  instead  of  a  traditional  one,  means  the  end  user  is  saving significant amount of money because less fuel is needed for her/his cooking needs.","8623","GS TPDDTEC v 1.","Small Scale","Standalone",""

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.","42222","AMS-II.G.

Micro-entrepreneurs: low greenhouse gas emitting water purification technologies offer scope for micro-entrepreneurs, thereby creating jobs and supporting families.Economic sustainability and expansion: under this program, there is a direct incentive to ensure that the projects are successful, in that these same projects serve to fund further development. There is no disconnecting between funding and public health outcomes. b)Health benefitsImproved indoor quality: polluted indoor air due to open and uncontrolled combustion is a huge health concern in many developing countries. Low greenhouse gas emitting water disinfection technologies tackle this problem by reducing the combustion of wood/fossil fuels.Improved water: Almost a billion people lack access to safe drinking water. Water-borne disease is a leading cause of illness in the developing world, contributing to the death of two million children every year, on average. Providing safe drinking water to additional households/communities will have a significant impact on child mortality. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target aims to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking-water. Strides have been made in improving access to safe drinking water and the world is projected to exceed this target. Nevertheless, by 2015, there will still be 672 million people who will not have access to improved drinking water. Furthermore, many more drink water that qualifies as improved but is nevertheless contaminated and poses health risks. (WHO, 2007; WHO and UNICEF, 2010)Improved indoor quality: polluted indoor air due to open and uncontrolled combustion is a huge health concern in many developing countries.

Ltd.","Gold Standard Certified Project","1,3,6,8,13","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","Lao People's Democratic Republic","In Lao PDR, the surface water is plentiful but frequently it is of very poor quality and not safe to drink especially in rural areas. Around 30% of Lao population lacks access to a source of improved drinking water and are at risk of getting diarrhoea or other water borne diseases. Though, a significant fraction of Lao population treats water preferable by boiling using woody biomass, charcoal etc to make the water safe for drinking. There is a significant fraction of families even cannot afford firewood to boil water, hence are forced to continue to drink unsafe water.
TerraClear is a social enterprise, registered as a private limited company under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The enterprise is in the business of getting clean water to more people in Laos by selling the Lao Ceramic Water Purifier (CWP) to the population. CWP’s help people access safe drinking water, especially in rural areas, reduce time spent provisioning drinking water or collecting wood, reduce costs for families, reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improving attendance at school and increased productivity. Ceramic Water Purifiers provide for removal of microorganisms from water by gravity filtration through porous ceramics, with a typical flow rate at production of 1.5 - 3 litres per hour.  Originally TerraClear plans to sell over 100,000 CWP’s between 2012 and 2019 but this target seems a bit high as up to mid-2018, the total sale is just about 58,000 filters. It is estimated that by the end of its first crediting period (15th July 2019), the total sale would be about 67,000 CWPs.
 
With the new target, CWPs will provide safe drinking water for potentially more than 0.3 million people, and at the same time reduce the demand for water treatment through boiling water with non- renewable biomass. The CWP’s have a useful life of 5 years or more provided proper care and maintenance. The Lao Ceramic Water Purifiers are manufactured locally in Laos and therefore contribute to building a local industry and value added in Laos, as well as creating much needed sustainable jobs and business opportunities in rural areas. The project start date is 06/06/2012.  With the assistance of carbon finance, TerraClear can become a unique and on-going sustainable enterprise capable of providing emissions-free household water treatment options to rural households, and thereby improve public health, household welfare and economy, as well as contribute to reduced deforestation in Lao PDR.","33541","GS TPDDTEC v 1.","Small Scale","Standalone",""

Indeed, eighty-four (84) per cent of households use wood and charcoal on a daily basis. For that reason, there is a growing pressure on forests and the country currently looses 105,000 hectares of forested land every year according to the Ministry in charge of environmental issues (“Ministère de l’environnement et du développement durable""). High efficiency improved cookstoves and gas stoves help fight deforestation by significantly reducing the demand for wood and charcoal, and thus contribute to a global reduction in GHG emissions from biomass combustion. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called Nafa Naana with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all. Nafa Naana takes place in the context of the National Plan for the Environment (PANE) established in 1991 by the Government of Burkina Faso, and is financially supported by the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy. Nafa Naana  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distributes  more  efficient  charcoal and wood stoves,  LGP  stoves  and  solar  lanterns.  Nafa Naana is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. Financial services are offered to Nafa Naana clients either as group loans or individual loans to help  people  with  limited  financial  means  access those products. Finally, Nafa Naana is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as many energy products as possible in Burkina Faso. The project activity  “Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  wood  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fight  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  fumes  such  as  carbon  monoxide and PM 2.5 inside the homes of the beneficiary population. Indeed, the combustion of wood with traditional stoves releases toxic fumes in the air. These toxic fumes are one of the main causes of respiratory diseases among women and children.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cookstoves,  instead  of   traditional  ones,  means  that the  end  user  is  saving significant amounts of money because fuel expenses per gram of food cooked are lower for LPG than for wood when the wood is purchased by the user.","8877","GS TPDDTEC v 2.","Micro Scale","Standalone",""

• InfraVest Fongwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 13.8 MW (6x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Hsinfong Township (therefore also called Hsinfong Wind Farm), Hsinchu County, which comprises 6 wind turbines (hereafter: Fongwei Wind Farm).
• InfraVest Longwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 44.1 MW (18x2.3 MW + 3x0.9 MW) onshore wind farm located in Houlong Township (therefore also called Houlong Wind Farm), Miaoli County, which comprises 21 wind turbines (hereafter: Longwei Wind Farm).
• InfraVest Chungwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 29.9 MW (13x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Dajia and Da-An Townships, Taichung County, which covers Taichung phases I and III, and Dafong sites, and which comprises 13 wind turbines (hereafter: Chungwei Wind Farm). There are another 20 wind turbines also located in Dajia and Da- An Townships, Taichung County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 20 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS472), which was already registered in 2010. Therefore, the 13 wind turbines in Chungwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS472).
• InfraVest Tauwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 4.6 MW (2x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Guanyin Township (also called Hsinwu Wind Farm), Taoyuan County, which comprises 2 wind turbines (hereafter: Tauwei Wind Farm). There are another 19 wind turbines also located in Guanyin Township, Taoyuan County, which belong to the same project owner.

Therefore, the 2 wind turbines in Tauwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS612).
The above-mentioned four wind farms are constructed and operated by InfraVest Wind Power Group (hereafter refer as “InfraVest”), which is a subsidiary of Germany based VWind AG. The project in total comprises 42 wind turbines and the total installed capacity of the bundled project is 92.4 MW.
